## 1955 – 1965: 2nd Generations
Operating systems were first developed to manage tape storage.

The first OS was the “General Motors Operating System” made by IBM 701 (1955)

“Additional Information: IBM 701 was designed for scientific work and research, which led to the development of the FORTRAN programming language. Nineteen machines were built, a record volume for such a computer in that era. Its internal memory contained 2,048 36-bit words of electrostatic memory and 8,192 words of magnetic drum memory”

These were the Second Generation Computers which moved from machine language to symbolic.

That was when high-level language like COBOL and FORTRAN were also developed at a time.

COBOL stands for Common Business-Oriented Language, while FORTRAN stands for Formula Translation.

The COBOL computer programming language is a compiled English-like language designed for business. Businesses and governments have been using COBOL for years for business, finance, and administrative systems.

Operating Systems back then, was referred to as Single-Stream Batch Processing Systems, because the data was submitted in groups (batches)



“Additional Information: What is Batch-Processing Operating System?


The batch-processing operating system was very popular in the 1970s. In batch operating system the jobs were performed in batches. This means Jobs having similar requirements are grouped and executed as a group to speed up processing. Users using batch operating systems do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares their job using an offline device for example a punch card and submits it to the computer operator. Once the programmers have left their programs with the operator, they sort the programs with similar needs into batches.”
