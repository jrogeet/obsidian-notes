# 1.1 Professional software development

---

Software engineering is intended to support ___professional software development___, rather than __individual programming__.
It includes techniques that support program _specification_, _design_, and _evolution_, none of which are normally relevant for __personal software development__.

_Software_ is not just the programs themselves but also all associated __documentation__ and __configuration data__ that is required to make these programs operate correctly.

The system usually consists of a number of separate programs like:
- ___System Documentation___, which __describes the structure of the system__
- ___User Documentation___, which explains __how to use the system__
- ___Website___ for users to __download__ recent product information.

| What are the ___best___ software engineering __techniques__ and __methods__?          | While all software projects have to be professionally managed and developed, _different techniques are appropriate for different types of system_. For example, games should always be developed using a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed. You canâ€™t, therefore, say that one method is better than another. |
| What differences has the _Web made to software engineering_?                          | The Web has led to the availability of software services and the possibility of developing highly distributed service-based systems. Web-based systems development has led to important advances in programming languages and software reuse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |


## 2 kind of software products:

### 1. Generic Products
Stand-alone systems that are produced by a _development organization_ and __sold on the open market__ to _any customer_ who is able to buy them.
	Examples: 
	- __DATABASES__, 
	- ___WORD PROCESSORS___, 
	- __DRAWING PACKAGES__, and 
	- ___PROJECT-MANAGEMENT TOOLS___.
> [!NOTE]
> The Organization that develops the software __controls the software specification__.
### 2. Customized (or bespoke) products
- Systems that are _commissioned by a particular customer_.
- A software contractor develops the software __especially for that customer__.
	Examples:
	- _Control systems_ for Electronic devices
	- Systems written to __support a particular business process__,
	- _Air traffic control systems_
> [!NOTE]
> The Specification is usually _developed and controlled_ by the __organization that is buying the software__.
> The __software developers__ must _work to that specification_.
