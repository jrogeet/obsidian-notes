# 1.1.1 Software Engineering

---
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with ___all aspects of software production___ from the __early stages of system specification__ through to __maintaining__ the system __after it has gone into use__.

2 Key Phrases of this definition:
	1. ___Engineering discipline___: Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable theories and methods.
	2. ___All aspects of software production___: Software engineering also includes activities such as __software project management__ and the __development of tools__, __methods__, and __theories to support software production__.

| Product characteristics    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintainability            | Software should be written in such a way so that __it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers__. This is a critical attribute because ___software change is an inevitable___ requirement of _a changing business environment_.                                             |
| Dependability and Security | Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including _reliability_, _security_, and _safety_. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. __Malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system__. |
| Efficiency                 | Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes __responsiveness__, _processing time_, __memory utilization__, etc                                                                                       |
| Acceptability              | Software must be __acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed__. This means that it must be _understandable_, __usable__, and __compatible__ with other systems that they use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |


## Software engineering is important for two reasons:
1. More and more, __individuals and society rely on advanced software systems__. We need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.
2. It is usually ___cheaper___, in the long run, __to use software engineering methods and techniques__ for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project.


##  Software process
The _systematic approach_ that is used in software engineering.

A software process is a __sequence of activities__ that leads to the production of a software product.

### Four Fundamental Activities common to all software process:

1. ___Software specification___, where customers and engineers __define the software__ that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation. 
2.  ___Software development___, where the software is __designed__ and __programmed__. 
3. ___Software validation___, where the software is __checked__ to ensure that it is what the customer requires. 
4. ___Software evolution___, where the software is __modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements__
