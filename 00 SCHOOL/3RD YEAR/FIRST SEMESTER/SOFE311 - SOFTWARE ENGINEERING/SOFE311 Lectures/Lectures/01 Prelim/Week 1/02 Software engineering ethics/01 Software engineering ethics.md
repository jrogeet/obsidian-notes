# 01 Software engineering ethics

---

As a software engineer, you must accept that your job involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills. 
You must also behave in an ethical and morally responsible way if you are to be respected as a professional engineer.

You should uphold normal standards of honesty and integrity.

You should __not use your skills and abilities to behave in a dishonest way__ or in a way that will bring disrepute to the software engineering profession.

There are areas where standards of acceptable behavior are not bound by laws but by the more tenuous notion of professional responsibility. 
Some of these are:
	1. ___Confidentiality___ You should normally respect the confidentiality of your employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.
	2. ___Competence___ You should not misrepresent your level of competence. __You should not knowingly accept work that is outside your competence__
	3. ___Intellectual property rights___ You should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents and copyright. You should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
	4. ___Computer misuse___ __You should not use your technical skills to misuse other people’s computers__. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing on an employer’s machine, say) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses or other malware).

>  The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code. Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles: 
>  1. ___PUBLIC___ — Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. 
>  2. ___CLIENT AND EMPLOYER___ — Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest. 
>  3. ___PRODUCT___ — Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible. 
>  4. ___JUDGMENT___ — Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment. 
>  5. ___MANAGEMENT___ — Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance. 
>  6. ___PROFESSION___ — Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest. 
>  7. ___COLLEAGUES___ — Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. 
>  8. ___SELF___ — Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
