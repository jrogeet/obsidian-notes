|COLLEGE|COMPUTER STUDIES|**COURSE DESCRIPTION**<br><br>The course focuses on the development of a Project that can be integrated in the management of various industries such as business, medicine, education, and even in the home and thus across multiple platforms with specific computer algorithm . The course immerses the learner on the role of an CS Professional to find, understand, and solve real life problems with the use of technology. This also expose and familiarizes student in the different procedures in the planning, analyzing, designing, implementation, and maintaining a System as well as managing these different phases to ensure success of the project. This includes meaningfully relating with fellow CS students to cooperatively learn from their different experiences.<br><br>  <br>**COURSE EXPECTED OUTCOMES (CEO)**<br><br>After successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:<br><br>1. Analyze and create a model of an Information System by following the appropriate System Development Life Cycle.<br>2. Identify feasible CS projects.<br>3. Develop Project Plan and Manage Plan.<br>4. Undergo requirements determination.<br>5. Conduct the following system analysis tasks:<br>    1. Requirements Determination<br>    2. Use Case Analysis<br>    3. Process Modeling<br>    4. Data Modeling|
