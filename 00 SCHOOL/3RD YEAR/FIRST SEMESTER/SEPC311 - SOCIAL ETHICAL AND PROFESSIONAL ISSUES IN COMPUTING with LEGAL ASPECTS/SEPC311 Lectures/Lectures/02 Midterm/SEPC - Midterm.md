The definition also extends to a secret formula or process not patented, but known only to certain individuals using it in compounding some article of trade having a commercial value.
>>
>>>[!EXAMPLE] Sample Situation:
>>> - So, if computer programs will be considered a “trade secret”, then it would have the effect of giving the employer the right to restrain their programmers to reveal the code and use them outside.
>>>  - Generally, programs are NOT “trade secret”. However, this rule admits of an exception. To illustrate,
>>> - Last May 2011 while taking my halo-halo at RAZON’S, one of the customers asked one of the service crew, “Kakaiba lasa ng gatas nyo ah. Anong gatas ginagamit nyo?” To that, the service crew responded, “Sorry po ma’am hindi po kami allowed sabihin”.
>>>
>>>> [!done] Situation Analysis:
>>>>  In the above illustration, the above secrets have a direct relation with respect to the nature of Razon’s business. However, the source code of the system cannot, by any stretch of imagination be considered as a “trade secret”. The reason is very obvious. Because the source code of the program will NOT give Razon’s an opportunity to obtain an advantage over its competitors who do not possess the information. Neither the revelation of the program could affect the business of Razon’s.
>>>
>>> On the contrary, if Andrei is an employee of Microsoft Corporation whose main task is to develop and maintain programs for Microsoft, the source code shall be considered as a “trade secret”. Only Microsoft Corporation can improve its current software because it is the only person, along with its employees, who have the source code of all Microsoft’s products. If the source code will be illegally revealed to others, the exclusivity of the source will be lost and hence, will adversely affect the business of Microsoft.

>> - Freedom of Expression is essential for the __search of truth__.
>> 	- This is the marketplace of Idea which points the power of thought can be tested by its acceptability in the competition in the market.
>>> [!quote]  
>>> “But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas —that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. “ – Justice Holmes

>> the __successive right to freedom of speech was non-existent.__ The law as it was intended to be simply ceased to be, all that existed was the whim of a dictator who sat with the entire nation in his grasp.
