## Host Roles

Every computer on a network is called a host or end device.

___Servers___ are computers that provide information to end devices:
- email servers
- web servers
- file server

___Clients___ are computers that send requests to the servers to retrieve information:
- web page from a web server
- email from an email server

| Server Type | Description                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email       | Email server runs email server software. Clients use client software to access email.  |
| Web         | Web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software to access web pages. |
| File        |    File server stores corporate and user files. The client devices access these files.                                                                                    |

## Peer-to-Peer
It is possible to have a device be a ___client___ and a ___server___ in a __Peer-to-Peer Network__. 
This type of network design is only recommended for very small networks.

| Advantages                                                     | Disadvantages                 |   
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Easy to set up                                                 | No centralized administration |     
| Less complex                                                   | Not as secure                 |  
| Lower cost                                                     | Not scalable                  | 
| Used for simple tasks: transferring files and sharing printers | Slower performance            |   


## End Devices
An end device is where a message originates from or where it is received. 
Data originates with an end device, flows through the network, and arrives at an end device.

## Intermediary Network Devices
An intermediary device __interconnects__ end devices.
Examples include _switches, wireless access points, routers, and firewalls._

Management of data as it flows through a network is also the role of an intermediary device, including:

- Regenerate and retransmit data signals.
- Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network.
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures.

## Network Media
Communication across a network is carried through a medium which allows a message to travel from source to destination.
 
| Media Types                                               | Description                                                       |  
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metal wires within cables                                 | Uses electrical impulses                                          |    
| Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) | Uses pulses of light.                                             |   
| Wireless transmission                                     | Uses modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves. |
