## Internet Access Technologies
There are many ways to connect users and organizations to the internet:

- Popular services for home users and small offices include broadband cable, broadband digital subscriber line (DSL), wireless WANs, and mobile services.

- Organizations need faster connections to support IP phones, video conferencing and data center storage.

- Business-class interconnections are usually provided by service providers (SP) and may include:  business DSL, leased lines, and Metro Ethernet.

|Ethernet WAN|This extends LAN access technology into the WAN.|
|DSL|Business DSL is available in various formats including Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (SDSL).|
|Satellite|This can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available.|

## The Converging Network
Before converged networks, an organization would have been separately cabled for telephone, video, and data. Each of these networks would use different technologies to carry the signal.

Each of these technologies would use a different set of rules and standards.

Converged data networks carry multiple services on one link including:

- data
- voice
- video

Converged networks can deliver data, voice, and video over the same network infrastructure. The network infrastructure uses the same set of rules and standards.
