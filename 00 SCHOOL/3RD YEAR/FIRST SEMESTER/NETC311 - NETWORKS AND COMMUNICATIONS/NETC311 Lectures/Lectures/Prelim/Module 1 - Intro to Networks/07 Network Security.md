## Security Threats
![[Pasted image 20231001171842.png]]
- Network security is an integral part of networking regardless of the size of the network.

- The network security that is implemented must take into account the environment while securing the data, but still allowing for quality of service that is expected of the network.

- Securing a network involves many protocols, technologies, devices, tools, and techniques in order to secure data and mitigate threats.

- Threat vectors might be external or internal.

___External Threats:___
- Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
- Spyware and adware
- Zero day attacks
- Threat Actor attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Data interception and theft
- Identity theft

___Internal Threats:___
- lost or stolen devices
- accidental misuse by employees
- malicious employees

## Security Solutions

Security must be implemented in multiple layers using more than one security solution.

Network security components for home or small office network:
- Antivirus and antispyware software should be installed on end devices.
- Firewall filtering used to block unauthorized access to the network.

Larger networks have additional security requirements:

- Dedicated firewall system
- Access control lists (ACL)
- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- Virtual private networks (VPN)

The study of network security starts with a clear understanding of the underlying switching and routing infrastructure.
