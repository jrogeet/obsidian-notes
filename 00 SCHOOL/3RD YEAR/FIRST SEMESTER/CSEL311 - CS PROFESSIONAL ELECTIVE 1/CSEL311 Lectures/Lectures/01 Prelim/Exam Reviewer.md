# Types of Media

## **INTRODUCTION**

An organized and thorough design brief can be quite satisfying for a graphic designer. The intended aim, purpose, and the exact media that will be used for the design must all be understood before a design project can begin. One of the difficulties you may have as a graphic designer is effectively demonstrating how well you understand the objectives of the client. 

## **WHAT IS MEDIA DESIGN?**

The term "multimedia" describes the use of various media types in a single presentation or communication, including text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. The process of developing a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system is referred to as design, on the other hand.

The term multimedia and design are frequently combined to describe the production of digital material that incorporates a range of media formats. In order to engage consumers and deliver information, this may entail developing websites, video games, or other interactive experiences that incorporate text, audio, video, and other aspects.

To develop successful and aesthetically pleasing multimedia material, designers in this sector may employ a range of tools and approaches, including graphic design, user experience (UX) design, and user interface (UI) design.

## **TYPES OF MEDIA**

**PRINT MEDIA**

Print media includes the conventional forms of printed publications like books, magazines, and newspapers. Text and images are printed on tangible materials like paper or card stock to create these materials. Print media has been used for communication and information distribution for many years and is still widely used today. It frequently serves as a source of news, advertising, and entertainment.

# Branding and Product Packaging

## **INTRODUCTION**

Brand Packaging is a tool that aids businesses in developing powerful branding strategies through packaging design. By combining packaging and design, firms may stand out from the competition and be perceived as a reflection of their target audience's lifestyle. Information on trends, news, and innovations pertaining to consumer packaged goods is made available to brand owners, designers, suppliers, and marketers through this resource. It helps businesses keep up with the most recent advances in the industry and covers a variety of issues relating to packaging design and branding.

## **WHAT IS BRANDING?**

Branding is the process of establishing a product or service in the consumer's mind a distinctive name and image through advertising campaigns with a consistent concept. It is intended to raise the value of the good or service and set it apart from alternatives. The overarching objective of branding is to foster brand loyalty and positive attitudes, which will increase sales.

**BRAND NAME**

A brand name is a name or term that is used to identify a particular brand or product. The brand name is often used in conjunction with a logo or other visual elements to create a brand identity that is easily recognizable by consumers. A brand name can be a word, phrase, or symbol that is used to represent a company or its products. Examples are: Apple, Google, Nike, Coca-Cola, Microsoft

**BRAND MARK**

A brand mark is a logo or other graphic component that is used to identify a firm or brand. It frequently goes along with a brand name to form a full brand identity. An image, icon, or emblem that is instantly identifiable and aids in differentiating a company from its rivals can serve as a brand mark. Some examples of brand marks include the Nike swoosh, the Apple apple, and the Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star.  

Since brand markings are easily recalled and connected to favorable experiences and impressions of the business, they can be effective instruments for fostering brand recognition and customer loyalty.

**TRADE MARK**

A trademark is a form of intellectual property intended to safeguard distinctive words, phrases, symbols, or designs that are used to identify and distinguish a product or service apart from others. The use of trademarks serves to safeguard a company's reputation and goodwill while discouraging competitors from adopting marks that could lead to customer confusion. To gain legal protection and to make it simpler to enforce the rights connected to the mark, trademarks can be registered with the government. A trademark registration is typically valid for ten to twenty years before it expires and can then be extended for further times.

Word marks (such as "Coca-Cola"), design marks (such as the Nike swoosh), and trade dress are a few examples of the various sorts of trademarks (e.g., the distinctive red and white packaging of Coca-Cola). A mark must be distinctive and not be confusingly similar to any other trademarks in order to qualify for trademark protection. Trademarks are valuable assets in and of themselves and can play a significant role in a brand's intellectual property portfolio.

**BRAND ELEMENTS**

To choose brand aspects that effectively express your brand identity and connect with your target audience, you should take into account a number of factors. When choosing brand aspects, some typical factors to take into account are as follows:

- **Relevance**: The components you pick must be appropriate for your brand and the products and services you provide.
- **Differentiation**: Your brand's elements has to let you stand out from the competition.
- **Consistency**: Each aspect of your brand should complement the others and your overall brand identity.
- **Flexibility**: The characteristics of your brand should be adaptable enough to be used in a range of settings and across various media.
- **Memorable**: The contents of your brand should be appealing to consumers and simple for them to recall.
- **Timeless**: The elements of your brand should be durable and should not easily go out of style.
- **Emotional Impact**: Your brand's elements should evoke feelings in your target market and contribute to the creation of an emotional bond with your identity.
- **Cultural Fit**: Your brand's elements should be suitable for both your target market and the environment in which they function.
- **Legal Considerations**: You should make absolutely sure that none of your brand features violate any existing copyrights or trademarks.

## **WHAT IS PACKAGING?**

Product packaging refers to all aspects of a product's packaging, including the container it is sold in and any additional packing or labeling. The major goals of product packaging are to present the product in an appealing way to consumers and to safeguard the goods during handling, storage, and transportation. Product packaging can assist in communicating the brand's image and values to customers, which is another way it contributes to branding.

**PACKAGE DESIGN COMPONENTS**

There are several components that can be included in packaging design, including:  

- **The Package Itself**: The actual container or wrapper for the goods is called the package. It may be constructed from several materials, including cardboard, plastic, glass, or metal.
- **Labeling**: Labeling is anything written or drawn on a package, such as the name of the company, the name of the item, a list of the ingredients, and usage guidelines.
- **Graphics and Imagery**:  This category comprises any visual components needed to convey a brand's and a product's benefits, such as logos, pictures, or illustrations.
- **Color and Design**: A brand's overall appearance and feel can be conveyed through the use of color and design components, which can also serve to draw in and keep customers.
- **Shape and Size**: Should be taken into consideration during the design process as they might have an impact on the package's overall appeal and usage.
- **Materials and Sustainability**: The packaging materials used for a product can affect its environmental sustainability, and some businesses may opt to employ eco-friendly materials to appeal to consumers who are concerned about the environment.

**FUNCTION OF PACKAGING** 

Among the many crucial purposes that packaging fulfills are the following:

- **Protecting the Product**: Packaging aids in protecting the product from damage during storage and transit. It can also aid in protecting the goods from outside influences like sand, moisture, and tampering.
- **Facilitating Handling and Use**: Whether it is through the use of tamper-evident seals, easy-open features, or clear instructions, packaging should be made in a way that makes it simple for customers to handle and utilize the product.
- **Providing Information**: Informational packaging should contain all pertinent product details, including ingredients, usage instructions, and any appropriate warnings or cautionary notes. 
- **Promoting the Product**: A product's packaging, which frequently serves as the first point of contact between a customer and the product, can help draw in and keep customers. Good packaging design can influence how consumers perceive the value of the product as well as aid to express the brand's essential themes and values.
- **Supporting Logistics:** Packaging can be made to maximize space consumption during storage and transit as well as distribution and handling of items.

**STANDARD PACKAGE DESIGN SIZE**

When we talk about packaging standard sizes, we're talking about the measurements that have been set for different kinds of packaging, such boxes, bottles, and cans. These standard sizes are frequently based on industry norms and are intended to increase the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of packing. Standardizing sizing, for instance, enables packaging to be more accurately matched to the size of the product it will hold, so reducing material waste.

Standard sizes can also make it simpler to carry and store goods because identically sized packages can be stacked and stored more effectively. Additionally, uniform sizing can make it simpler for customers to assess the volume and size of various products because they would be able to more readily compare the packaging's measurements.

**FACTORS TO CONSIDER REGARDING DESIGN** 

There are several factors to consider when designing packaging, including:

- **Target Market**: When creating packaging, it's critical to take the needs and tastes of the market into account. This may involve elements like age, gender, financial level, and way of life.
- **Product Characteristics**: The packaging should be designed to fit the product's size, shape, and purpose.
- **Brand Image**: Packaging should be consistent with the overall brand identity and reflect the brand's image and values.
- **Competition**: It is indeed crucial to take into account the packaging of identical products on the market, since the design should set the product apart from the rivals.
- **Production and Distribution**: The design should take into account the logistics of the manufacturing and distribution process, including any transportation and storage needs.

## **WHAT IS LABELLING?**

Product labeling is the term used to describe the details that are printed on a product's package or label. This information can consist of the name of the product, its components, how to use it, and any relevant cautionary or warning remarks. Product labeling is a crucial component of product packaging because it gives buyers crucial knowledge about the product and facilitates informed purchasing decisions. In order to guarantee that the information presented is true and that it complies with particular criteria, a number of government entities also oversee product labeling.

**LABELLING COMPONENTS** 

Some of the components that may be included in product labeling are:

- **Product Name**: The product's name should be prominently and clearly stated on the packaging.
- **Ingredients**: The packaging should provide a list of the ingredients used in the product, either on the main label or on a separate information panel.
- **Net Weight or Volume**: The packaging for the product should clearly state the product's net weight or volume.
- **Usage Guidance**: The packaging should contain any relevant usage guidance, such as how to use the product or how to apply it.
- **Warnings and Cautionary Notes**: The product's packaging should make it abundantly obvious whether it includes any potentially dangerous components or poses any hazards to users.
- **Date of Expiration**: or "best by": If the product has a short shelf life, this information needs to be on the container.
- **Company Information**: The manufacturer's or distributor's name and contact details must to be printed on the box.
- **Country of Origin**: The packaging should include information about the nation in which the product was manufactured or put together.

# Target Audience and Market Segment

## **INTRODUCTION**

Businesses must identify and comprehend their target market segment and customer base in today's competitive marketplace. Understanding the traits and demands of the target audience—the particular set of individuals for whom a product or service is intended—can assist a firm in developing an effective marketing strategy. According to variables like age, gender, economic level, and interests, the market is segmented into smaller, more focused groups of consumers.

Businesses can better address the needs of particular customer groups and stand out in the market by segmenting the market and then tailoring their products and marketing strategies to do so. Businesses can improve their chances of success and expand their customer base in this way by identifying and comprehending the target market group and audience.

## **WHAT IS TARGET AUDIENCE?**

The specified set of people for whom a product or service is designed is referred to as the target audience. Identifying and comprehending the traits and requirements of the target market is crucial when creating a product or marketing strategy. A company that sells children's toys, for instance, will probably have a different target market than one that offers high-end luxury vehicles.

A company can develop goods or marketing initiatives that appeal to and successfully reach the target audience by having a thorough understanding of the demographics, interests, and demands of this group.

## **WHAT IS MARKET SEGMENT?**

The technique of splitting a market into smaller, more specialized groups of customers with comparable demands or features is known as market segmentation. This enables a corporation to target particular market segments with its products or marketing initiatives and better serve their requirements. Age, gender, economic level, location, and interests are just a few of the variables that can be used to segment the market.

An organization can build items that specifically cater to the needs of various consumer groups by segmenting the market and developing customized marketing strategies. This can improve the company's chances of success and help it stand out in the marketplace.

**MARKET SEGMENT VARIABLES**

There are several variables that can be used to segment a market:

- **Demographic Variables**: Demographic variables include characteristics such as age, gender, income level, education level, and geographic location.
- **Psychographic Variables**: Psychographic variables refer to characteristics related to a person's values, attitudes, and interests. These can include lifestyle, personality, and values.
- **Behavioral Variables**: Behavioral variables refer to how consumers behave or what they do. These can include factors such as purchasing habits, usage rate, and loyalty.
- **Geographic Variables**: Geographic variables include characteristics related to a person's location, such as region, country, or city.

## **FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING  
THE TARGET AUDIENCE/ MARKET SECTOR FOR  
SPECIFIC DESIGN**

**WHAT IS YOUR CLIENT'S COMPANY NAME?**

It is important to provide your designers with the name of the client's company and an overview of the client's business or organization. This information will help the designers understand the context and purpose of the design work they are completing.

**WHAT DOES THIER BUSINESS/ ORGANIZATION DO?**

It is also important to let the designers know if the design is for a product or service that the client is selling, as this will help them create designs that effectively support the client's business goals.  

**WHAT IS THEIR INDUSTRY SECTOR**

When providing context for a design project, it is crucial to mention the industry in which the customer operates. Healthcare and pharmaceuticals, airlines, the food and beverage industry, financial services, household and consumer goods, government, industrial and manufacturing, retail, sports and entertainment, technology and communications, telecommunications and mobility, tourism and hospitality, restaurants, real estate and development, and beverages are a few examples of potential industries that a client might be involved in.

Designers will be able to provide designs that are appropriate and successful for the client's particular business and market with the aid of an understanding of the sector.

**WHO IS THIER PRIMARY TARGET**

When determining the target audience for a design project, it is important to consider factors such as age, gender, income, occupation, and location. In addition to these demographic characteristics, it is also helpful to consider the lifestyle and business needs of the target audience in order to create designs that are relevant and effective.

It is important to ask whether the client is seeking to appeal to an existing target audience or if they are trying to reach a new audience. This information will help guide the design process and ensure that the final product effectively targets the desired audience.

# Design Brief

## **INTRODUCTION**

Visual elements like font, color, and images are used in the creative field of visual graphics design to convey ideas and messages to a target audience. It is an essential component of brand identification and significantly affects how the public views a business or organization. Visual graphics design serves to convey information, tell a story, and interest the spectator whether it be through print materials, digital media, or physical items.

Graphic design, branding, advertising, and user interface design are just a few of the many disciplines that fall under the umbrella of visual graphics design, which is continually growing. A strong foundation in aesthetics, technical proficiency, and strategic thinking are essential in this dynamic and diverse sector.

## **WHAT IS DESIGN BRIEF?**

A design brief is a document that outlines the objectives, requirements, and constraints of a design project. It provides a clear and concise summary of what needs to be designed, for whom it is being designed, and how it will be used. The design brief serves as a road map for the design process, helping to ensure that the final design meets the needs of the client and the target audience.

It also helps to align the expectations of all stakeholders and helps to identify any potential issues or challenges that may arise during the design process. A well-written design brief helps to guide the design team and ensure that they are able to deliver a successful and effective solution.  

## **WHAT TO INCLUDE IN A DESIGN BRIEF?**

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

A portion of a design brief called the project overview gives a broad overview of the design project. It should provide a high-level summary of what will be produced together with an explanation of the project's goals and parameters. Without going into excessive detail, the project overview should provide enough details to give a clear idea of the project.

It should outline the project's primary aims and objectives as well as any restrictions or limitations that must be taken into account. The target market and the intended purpose of the finished product should both be described in the project overview.

To create the project overview section of the design brief, you can ask yourself or your client the following questions:

- What is the main focus of the design project?
- What design issue are we trying to address?
- What specific assets will be produced as part of the project?

These questions will help you understand the scope and purpose of the project, as well as what will be expected at its completion.

**GOALS & OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW DESIGN**

To clearly define the expected consequences of a design project, goals and objectives must be set during the planning stage. Goals are the overall aim of the project, whereas objectives are specific, quantifiable milestones that help in reaching them. If these elements are outlined in the project brief, the work will be guided more successfully and the project will stay on track.

To help clarify the goals and objectives of a project, consider asking the following questions:

- What is the desired outcome of the project?
- Is this project focused on redesigning something that already exists, and if so, why?
- Is this the first time that this particular design problem is being addressed?

**TARGET MARKET/ AUDIENCE**

It's crucial to first comprehend your audience in order to answer their demands successfully. Making a persona for your ideal client is one method for accomplishing this. Take into account their psychographics, demographics, and the issues that your solution can help them with.

When creating your client persona, you should take into account the following issues:

- Who is the perfect client for you?
- What are their characteristics, routines, and objectives?
- When and how will your product be used by people?

**BUDGET & SCHEDULE**

It is essential to establish a budget and timeline for a design project in order to ensure that it stays on track and meets all necessary deadlines. To do this, you will need to clarify any budget constraints and any internal deadlines that the project must align with. It may also be helpful to identify key milestones within the project. Clearly defining these limitations and expectations from the beginning will help prevent conflicts and scope creep.

You can use the following questions to gather this information:

- What are the budget limitations for this project and how flexible are they?
- What internal deadlines must this project adhere to?
- What are the key milestones that will be reached during the project?

**PROJECT DELIVERABLES**

One of the primary goals of a design brief is to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the expected deliverables for the project. Miscommunications about the project goals and deliverables can lead to significant issues, so it is important to address any uncertainties or misunderstandings as early as possible. To clarify the necessary deliverables, you can ask the following questions:

- What is expected to be received at the end of the project?
- In what file format should the work be supplied?
- What are the necessary sizes and resolutions for the final deliverables?

Answering these questions will help ensure that everyone is on the same page about the project goals and what will be produced at its completion.

**OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION**

It may be necessary to include additional information in the design brief, depending on the specifics of the project.  

- This could include information about competitors, any creative constraints or guidelines, and the approval process.

# Familiarity in Different Graphics Applications

## **INTRODUCTION**

The term "graphics applications" refers to computer programs that enable users to generate and edit visual information for a variety of uses, including print items, websites, and social media posts. These tools give designers the ability to produce and change graphics, typography, and layouts, as well as add color, texture, and other visual components. Because they offer a wide range of features and capabilities that enable designers to rapidly and effectively create high-quality visual content, graphics apps have evolved into a crucial tool for professionals in the design business.

## **WHAT IS GRAPHICS?**

Visual representations of information, facts, or concepts are known as graphics. They are used to clearly and concisely convey information to an audience and can take the shape of photographs, diagrams, charts, maps, or other visual media. Depending on the intended usage and the techniques used to construct them, they might be static or dynamic. Graphics can be a powerful tool for engaging and grabbing the attention of an audience and are frequently used to communicate difficult information in a way that is easier to understand.

**GRAPHIC APPLICATIONS AND ITS BACKGROUND**

Graphic design software is used to create and manipulate visual elements for a variety of purposes, such as print materials, websites, and social media posts. As technology improved, a lot of graphic tools were developed for making a graphic design. These are the graphic programs available in the market for multimedia applications.  

The most basic programs are those that come with operating systems (such as Microsoft Paint, which comes with Windows 95 and Windows 98) and those that are included in authoring programs used to create multimedia applications. These programs are relatively unsophisticated and, as a result, lack many features found in high-end programs.   
In computer graphics, graphics software or image editing software is a program or collection of programs that enable a person to manipulate visual images on a computer.  

Computer graphics can be divided into two categories: raster graphics and vector graphics. Raster graphics are made up of pixels, while vector graphics are made up of lines and curves. Many graphic design programs specialize in one type of graphics or the other, but some offer a combination of both. It is relatively easy to convert raster graphics to vector graphics, but the reverse process is more complex. Some software programs are designed to do this, however. In addition to static graphics, there are also animation and video editing software that allow users to create dynamic visual content.

## **TYPES OF GRAPHIC SOFTWARES**

There are several types of graphic design software available, including:

- **Raster Graphics Editors**: These programs are used to create and edit raster graphics, which are made up of pixels.  
    Examples include Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.
- **Vector Graphics Editors**: These programs are used to create and edit vector graphics, which are made up of lines and curves.  
    Examples include Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.
- **Page Layout Software**: These programs are used to create print documents, such as brochures, magazines, and books.  
    Examples include Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress.
- **3D Modeling Software**: These programs are used to create three-dimensional objects and scenes.  
    Examples include Autodesk Maya and Blender.
- **Animation Software**: These programs are used to create animated graphics and videos.  
    Examples include Adobe After Effects and Toon Boom Harmony.
- **Video Editing Software**: These programs are used to edit and enhance video footage.  
    Examples include Adobe Premiere Pro and Avid Media Composer.

## **PRINCIPLE OF GRAPHIC DESIGN**

There are several principles of graphic design that are commonly used to create effective and aesthetically pleasing visual content:

- **Balance**: Balance refers to the distribution of visual elements in a design, such as the use of whitespace, the size of objects, and the use of color.
- **Contrast**: Contrast refers to the use of differences in visual elements, such as size, color, and texture, to draw attention and create emphasis.
- **Hierarchy**: Hierarchy refers to the arrangement of visual elements in a design to indicate importance and create a clear visual flow.
- **Alignment**: Alignment refers to the arrangement of visual elements along common lines or axes, creating a cohesive and organized design.
- **Repetition**: Repetition refers to the use of repeated elements, such as color, shape, or pattern, to create unity and cohesiveness in a design.
- **Proximity**: Proximity refers to the arrangement of visual elements in close proximity to each other, indicating a relationship between them.

# Relevant Intellectual Property Rights Provisions

## **INTRODUCTION**

In this lesson, we will discuss the concept of intellectual property rights and the importance of protecting these rights in the modern world. We will explore the various types of intellectual property rights, the ways in which they are protected, and how they can be enforced.

## **WHAT IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS?**

Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are legal protections for human creations including inventions, designs, and works of art. The creator or inventor of the work is granted these rights, enabling them to manage how their creation is used and distributed. By giving artists protection and enabling them to receive a just reward for their labors, IPRs are meant to promote innovation and creativity.

## **TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS?**

**PATENT**

An innovation is granted an exclusive privilege known as a patent. Generally speaking, a patent gives the owner the authority to decide if or how others may utilize an innovation. In return for this privilege, the patent holder publishes technical details about the innovation in the patent document for public consumption. The protection is granted for a limited period, generally twenty years from the filing date of the application.

**TRADEMARK**

A trademark is a sign or symbol used to uniquely identify a product or service and distinguish it from other companies' offerings. Trademarks have been used since ancient times, when artisans would mark their products with a symbol or signature to indicate the maker. Trademarks are essential for businesses, as they help to set them apart from the competition and protect their brand identity. The term of trademark registration can vary but is usually ten years. It can be renewed indefinitely on payment of additional fees.

**TRADE SECRET**

Trade secrets are intellectual property rights on private knowledge that can be licensed or sold. It is considered an unfair activity and a breach of the trade secret protection when others obtain, utilize, or disclose such secret information without authorization in a way that is inconsistent with honest commercial practices. Trade secret protection is not limited in time. It may continue indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public.

**COPYRIGHT**

Copyright is a type of legal protection that gives authors, musicians, painters, sculptors, filmmakers, computer programmers, database administrators, advertisers, maps, and technical drawing artists the sole right to their creations. Because of this unique right, authors can decide how their works are shared, used, and distributed. The time limit should be equal to or longer than fifty years after the creator’s death. Longer periods of protection may however be provided at the national level.

## **WHAT IS PHYSICAL PROPERTY RIGHTS?**

Physical property rights are the privileges that people or organizations have to manage and profit from particular tangible goods or resources. The ability to own, possess, use, transfer, or dispose of a specific tangible asset is one example of these rights. Physical property rights are typically separated into two groups: tangible and intangible. Real estate, vehicles, and boats are examples of tangible property, whereas patents, intellectual property, and copyrights are examples of intangible property. Physical property rights may also include the ability to restrict use of an asset or to forbid others from utilizing it.
