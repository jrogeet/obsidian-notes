___Cells___ are considered as the basic units of life.
Together, groups of cells that perform a common function result in the formation of a __tissue__.

## Tissue
There are four main types of tissue in the human body, which are _epithelial_, _connective_, _muscle_, and _nervous tissue_.
### Epithelial Tissue
__Epithelial tissue__ is responsible for covering body surfaces and lining internal cavities and organs.
This tissue is also responsible for _forming glands_.

![[Pasted image 20231003141941.png | 300]]
There are three types of cells that comprise the epithelial cells, which are __squamous epithelium__, __cuboidal epithelium__, and __columnar epithelium__. 
- ___Squamous epithelium___ features scale like cells. 
- ___Cuboidal epithelium___ contains cube-shaped cells. 
- ___Columnar epithelium___ consists of elongated, columnar-shaped cells.

> [!Two types of glands that are made up of epithelial cells]
> - _Exocrine glands_ secrete products to ducts which lead to body surfaces or cavities. 
> - __Endocrine glands__ lack ducts. Instead, these glands secrete their products to the bloodstream.
### Connective Tissue
___Connective tissue___ acts as fat storage, plays a role in immunity and in transport, and provides protection and support.

All connective tissues contain cells in an extracellular matrix composed of protein fibers and ground substance, which can be solid or liquid. 

One of the types of connective tissue is the __connective tissue proper__, which are further subdivided into loose and dense connective tissue.

___Loose connective tissue___ contains many cells but has fewer and more loosely woven fibers than are seen in the matrix of dense connective tissue. 
An example of _loose connective tissue_ is the __adipose tissue__
![[Pasted image 20231003143542.png | 550]]
__Dense connective tissue__ forms strong bands because of its large amounts of tightly woven fibers
![[Pasted image 20231003143637.png | 550]]
___Specialized connective tissue___ is categorized into the cartilage, bone, and blood. 
__Cartilage__ acts as a shock absorber between certain bones and maintains the structure of ears and the nose. 
_Bone_ serves as the main component of skeletal system. 

This tissue is a living tissue with a good blood supply for active metabolism and rapid healing. 
Meanwhile, ___blood___ is a _specialized connective tissue_ that is made up of a liquid matrix, called plasma. 
Suspended in the plasma are the so-called formed elements like cells and cell fragments called platelets.

___Connective tissues___ contain three types of __protein fibers__ produced by _fibroblasts_. 
- __Collagen fibers__ are strong and ropelike. These fibers can withstand pulling due to great tensile strength. 
- Meanwhile, __elastic fibers__ have random coils that allow the fibers to stretch and recoil like a spring. 
- __Reticular fibers__ are thin strands of collagen that branch extensively. The interconnecting networks of reticular fibers make the fibers suitable for supporting soft tissues.

___Blood___ consists of formed elements, which include the __red blood cells__, __white blood cells__, and __platelets__, that are suspended in a liquid matrix (plasma). 
Blood still feature fibers, which are normally dissolved in the plasma. 
These fibers play a role in blood clotting. Meanwhile, formed elements have varying functions. 
- __Red blood cells__ transport _oxygen and carbon dioxide_; 
- __white blood cells__ aid in _fighting infections_; 
- and __platelets__ function in _blood clotting_.

### Muscle Tissue
___Muscle Tissues___ are responsible for generating movement.
Muscle tissue is composed of __muscle fibers__. 
These fibers contract when stimulated, which results in a mechanical force. 

There are three types of muscle tissue, which are identified as skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. 
- ___Skeletal muscle tissue___ is usually __attached to bone__ and __performs voluntary movement__. 
	It can be identified through cross-striations visible under a microscope and the presence of several nuclei in each cell. 
- ___Cardiac muscle tissue___ is __found in the walls of the heart__ and unlike skeletal muscles, it is __involuntary__. 
	It also has cross-striations but it usually contains only one nucleus in each cell. 
- ___Smooth muscle tissue___ is __located in the walls of blood vessels, airways, and organs__. 
	It performs involuntary movements and unlike cardiac and skeletal muscles, it lacks striations. A smooth muscle cell tapers at each end and it has a single nucleus.

### Nervous Tissue
___Nervous tissue___ is the tissue responsible for coordinating body activities through initiation and transmission of nerve impulses. 
Nervous tissue consists of cells called __neurons__ and accessory cells called __neuroglia__.

__Neurons__ convert _stimuli_ into __nerve impulses__. 
These impulses travel to _glands_, _muscles_, or _other neurons_. 
Neuroglia speed up the rate traveled by the nerve impulses and it also nourishes neurons with materials from nearby blood vessels. 
Neuroglial cells can also communicate with one another and with neurons.

## Specialized Junctions
__Three types of specialized junctions hold tissues together__, and these are categorized as tight junctions, adhesion junctions, and gap junctions. 
- ___Tight junctions___ prevent the materials from passing through the locations where cells meet. 
- ___Adhesion junctions___ contain intercellular filaments attached to thickenings in the plasma membrane which allows cells to be linked together. 
- ___Gap junctions___ allow physical and chemical communication between cells through small pores between the cells.

## Organs

An ___organ___ is a structure that is composed of __two or more different tissues__ and has a specialized function. 
Multiple organs working together to perform a common function are collectively called an organ system. 

The human body has 11 major organ systems, which include 
- integumentary, 
- muscular, 
- skeletal, 
- nervous, 
- circulatory, 
- lymphatic, 
- respiratory, 
- endocrine, 
- urinary/excretory, 
- reproductive,
- digestive.

___Internal organs___ are located in _body cavities_, which are the __dorsal cavity__ and __ventral cavity__. 

The __dorsal cavity__ is subdivided into the cranial cavity that holds the brain and the spinal cavity that holds the spinal cord. 
The __ventral cavity__, which is subdivided into the thoracic (chest) cavity and the abdominal cavity. 
	The _thoracic cavity_, on the other hand, is divided into the pleural cavities and the pericardial cavity. 
		The _pleural cavity_ holds the lungs while the pericardial cavity contains the heart.


## Membranes
There are __four types of membranes__ that cover the organs, which include mucus, serous, synovial, and cutaneous membranes. 
- __Mucous membranes__ line passageways that are connected with the exterior of the body. 
- __Serous membranes__ are found along the thoracic and abdominal cavities and the organs within them. 
> These membranes secrete a fluid that lubricates the organs

- __Synovial membranes__ cover the cavities of freely movable joints and these membranes ease movement by lubricating the joints. 
- __Cutaneous membrane__, also known as the ___skin___, covers the outside of the body. To perform its function, it is thick, relatively waterproof, and relatively dry.

## Integumentary System
The ___integumentary system___ performs multiple functions including 
protecting underlying tissues from scratches and dehydration; 
regulating body temperature; 
synthesizing vitamin D; 
detecting stimuli associated with touch, 
changes in temperature, 
and pain; 
and initiating body defense mechanisms against pathogens. 

This system includes the ___skin___ and its derivatives, such as ___hair___, ___nails___, and ___sweat___ and ___oil glands___.

### Layers of the Skin
![[Pasted image 20231003172927.png | 400]]
The skin has two layers, which differ in terms of location and components. 

- The outermost layer, or __epidermis__, is composed of epithelial cells that die as keratin replaces their cytoplasmic content. 
	These cells are continuously replaced by the cells from the deepest layer of the epidermis. 
	
- The __dermis__ is located below the _epidermis_ and it is a much thicker, nondividing layer that contains connective tissue. Embedded in the connective tissue are the nerves, blood vessels, and glands. 
	This layer does not wear away and the nutrients destined for the epidermis pass out of the blood vessels in the dermis and diffuse towards the upper layer.
	The lower layer of the dermis consists of dense connective tissue containing collagen and elastic fibers. The combination of collagen and elastic fibers allows the skin to stretch and then return to its original shape. 

- Below the _dermis_ is the __hypodermis__, a layer of loose connective tissue that anchors the skin to underlying tissues. 
	The loose connective tissue, which often includes a layer of fat, insulates the body from extreme temperature and cushioning from blows.

### Epidermis
Cells of the epidermis produced in the deepest layer move toward the skin surface. 
As they move towards the surface, the cells flatten and die as they move away from the blood supply of the dermis and replace their cytoplasmic contents with keratin.

Skin color is partially determined by ___melanin___. 
___Melanin___ is a pigment released by melanocytes at the base of the epidermis. 
	This pigment is taken up by neighboring cells on their way to the surface. Blood flow and blood oxygen content also influence skin color.
![[Pasted image 20231003174154.png | 450]]
There are multiple skin derivatives, which include the hair, nails, and oil and sweat glands. 
The primary function of ___hair___ is protection 
while ___nails___ are modified skin tissue embedded and hardened by __keratin__. They protect the tips of our fingers and toes and help us grasp and manipulate small objects. 
Meanwhile, ___oil___ and ___sweat glands___ produces an oily substance called sebum, which lubricates the skin and hair, prevents desiccation, and inhibits the growth of certain bacteria.

## Homeostasis
___Homeostasis___ is the maintenance of constant internal environment at all levels of body organization. 
> If the body loses ability to maintain homeostasis, illness may occur.

![[Pasted image 20231003175624.png | 450]]
___Homeostasis___ is dynamic as long as it is centered around a set point. 
This environment is sustained primarily through negative feedback mechanisms, which are measures that slow or reverse a variation from the normal value of a factor, such as blood glucose level or body temperature, and return the factor to its normal value
___Homeostatic mechanisms___ consist of three components, which are the __receptors,__ a __control center__, and __effectors__. 
- __Receptor__ detects change in the internal or external environment while the control center determines the factor’s set point. 
- The __set point__ is the level or range that is considered normal for the factor being monitored. 
- __Effector__ carries out the response selected by the control center. The response occurs in changes in the action of a muscle or a gland

## Skeletal System
### Bone Function
The ___skeleton___ is a framework of __bone__ and __cartilage__. 
Its functions include to support and protect the internal organs.
It also plays a role in movement. Bones also provides places for attachment for muscles while the presence of joints allow the bones to move when muscles contract. 

Other functions include storage of minerals (calcium and phosphorus) and fat and the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
![[Pasted image 20231003181621.png | 400]]
### Bone Structure
- ___Compact bone___ is dense bone tissue found on the outside of all bones and it is covered by the periosteum, which is a membrane that nourishes the cells within the bone. 
	Also found within the bone is the spongy bone is a latticework of tiny, bony beams found in flat bones and near the knobby ends, or heads, of long bones. 
- ___Fatty yellow___ marrow occupies the cavity of the shaft of long bones. 
- ___Red marrow___ is found in the spongy bone of certain bones.

### Bone as Living Tissue
___Osteon___ is the structural unit of a bone and it consists of a central canal surrounded by concentric circles. 
These circles contain bone cells (osteocytes) embedded lacunae, which are cavities in a hard matrix. 
Cellular extensions of the osteocytes touch one another through tiny canals in the matrix, allowing exchange of materials between cells and the central canal. Bone matrix contains strands of collagen that is hardened by calcium and phosphorous salts.

![[Pasted image 20231003181811.png | 400]]
### Bones in the Embryo

![[Pasted image 20231003181834.png | 400]]
Most of the skeleton of the embryo appears first as ___cartilage___. 
As the individual ages, the __cartilage is gradually replaced by bone__ through a replacement process wherein osteoblasts form a bony collar around the shaft of the cartilaginous model.

After the formation of the bony collar, cartilage within the shaft breakdown and filling in the gaps is the bone. The cartilage in the heads (epiphyses) is the next part to be replaced. However, epiphyseal growth plates of cartilage remain. These growth plates allow bones to grow in length until the person is fully grown.

#### Effects of Growth Hormone
___Growth hormone___ originates from the anterior pituitary gland and its main function is to stimulate bone growth. 
___Sex hormones___ (estrogen and testosterone) are responsible for stimulating growth in puberty, but these same hormones also cause the growth plates to disappear. 
Once the growth plates disappear, bones cease to lengthen.

#### Bone Repair and Remodeling
![[Pasted image 20231003182232.png | 400]]
When the bone gets fractured, the repair of the bone begins with blood clot formation is followed by a cartilaginous callus. 
The ___callus___ is formed by fibroblast mass of collagen fibers and this structure links the broken ends. 
The ___callus___ is gradually replaced by bone.

Bone is constantly being remodeled through the action of osteoblast and osteoclast.
Osteoblasts deposit new bone when it is exposed to stress, while osteoclasts break bone down when it is not stressed.

__Bone remodeling is regulated by two hormones.__
___Calcitonin___, which comes from the thyroid gland, removes calcium from the blood and stores it in bone. 
Meanwhile, the ___parathyroid hormone (PTH)___, which is released by the parathyroid glands, releases calcium from the bone and reabsorbed into the blood.

### Axial and Appendicular Skeleton
The skeleton is described as consisting of two parts, identified as the ___axial___ and __appendicular__ skeleton. 
- The ___axial skeleton___ protects and supports internal organs and this part includes the skull, backbone, rib cage, and sternum.
- The ___appendicular skeleton___ is responsible for locomotion or the movement from place to place. This part includes the shoulders, pelvis, arms, and legs.
![[Pasted image 20231003182852.png | 400]]
### Joints
![[Pasted image 20231003182914.png | 400]]
___Joints___ are the term used for the places where bones meet. Joints are categorized by composition and degree of movement. 

Some joints are not moveable, and these include sutures between the skull bones. 
Meanwhile, ___synovial joints___ are freely movable. To allow for free movement, these joints have cartilage on the adjoining bone surfaces. 
	Moreover, the surfaces of the joints are surrounded by a synovial cavity filled with synovial fluid. These joints are held together by ligaments. 

Damage to a ligament is called a ___sprain___, which can be more painful than the actual damage caused by the injury.

The inflammation of the joint is called arthritis, and there are two categories based on the source of the inflammation. Osteoarthritis occurs when the surface of a joint degenerates because of repeated use while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, a condition wherein the immune system mistakenly attacks the body.
