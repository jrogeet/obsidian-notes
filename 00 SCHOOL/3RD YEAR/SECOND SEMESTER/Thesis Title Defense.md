>> 1. Develop an Authentication and Verification System for Contractors
>> 	 - This is to avoid those who ___pose or pretend as `Contractors`___ ,
>> 		 - with intentions to commit frauds against __`Home Owners`__. 
>> 	 - So __for Their Security__, we need a system to __validate the `Contractors` Identification__ upon registration through the website
>> 
>> 2. Implement a Job Posting and Proposal System
>> 	- `Home Owners` or the `Clients` can __post their available `Projects` or `Tasks`__ they need help with.
>> 	- There's gonna be like a __News Feed__ where `Contractors` can see the __Recent Job Posts__ just like in many Job Posting Websites .
>> 	- The `Contractors` __can send a `Proposal`__ to a ___Chosen Job Post___ and send their __Resume__ or a __Cover Letter__
>>

>> 	- After a ___Project___ is finished,  `Homeowners` can provide a __Rating__ or a __Feedback__  about the `Contractor's` __reliability, quality of work, and professionalism__
>> 	- And also `Contractors` can __Rate__ how the `Homeowner/Client` work well with them.
>> 		- This is for the __Future `Contractors`__ to see if the clients have bad history working with `Contractors`

>>

>> 	- To ensure the safety of both parties, we're implementing the __Escrow__ feature to avoid both parties from taking advantage of each other.
>> 	>[!info] Escrow Explanation:
>> 	> - A __Financial Arrangement__ where a middleman is included in-between the `Client/Homeowner` and the `Contractor` to __Hold Funds__ until the __Contractual Agreement__ has been fulfilled or completed.
>> 	> 	- This would help the `Homeowner/Client` to prevent the `Contractor` from receiving payment without completing the tasks.
>> 	> 	- Similarly, it ensures that the `Contractor `receives payment for their services upon successful completion of the agreed-upon tasks.
>> 	> 
>> 5. Optimize Search and Match Algorithm based on project requirements, geographical location, and contractor expertise.
>> 	- Enhance functionality of our Job Post Search Engine to __facilitate the identification__ of __suitable jobs for `Conctractors`__
>> 	- and for the `Homeowners/Client` to find the right `Contractor`
>> 
>> 6. Develop a user-friendly portfolio showcase interface
