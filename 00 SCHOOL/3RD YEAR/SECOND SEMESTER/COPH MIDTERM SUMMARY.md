## Fluid Motion

> [!abstract] Properties of Fluids
> A __FLUID__ is any material that ___flows___ and its shape changes to that of its ___container___.

>> [!info] Pressure
>> __Pressure__ is the ___concentration of a force___ – the force exerted per unit area
>> ![[Pasted image 20240418053935.png]]
>> (Pressure = Force / Area)
>> You can increase pressure 2 ways:
>> 1.Push harder (more force)
>> 2.Push with the same force but on a smaller area

>> The __density__ of a fluid is the __concentration of mass__

>> [!tip] Bernoulli's Principle
>> As the __speed__ of a fluid __increases__, the ___pressure decreases___
>> Applications of Principle to:
>> - Airplanes
>> - The game of Baseball
>> - Golf
>> - Race Cars

>> [!tip] Pascal's Principle
>> A change in __pressure__ at any point in an `enclosed fluid` will be transmitted __equally to all parts__ of that fluid
>> Applications of Principle to:
>> - Hydraulics
>> - Hydraulic Brakes
>> 
>> ![[Pasted image 20240418062051.png]]
>> Hydrostatic Equilibrium
>> - Pressure differences drive fluid flow
>> - If a fluid is in equilibrium, pressure forces must balance
>> - Pascal’s law: pressure change is transmitted through a fluid

>> [!tip] Archimedes' Principle
>> The `buoyant force` on an object in a fluid is an upward force equal to the __weight of the volume of fluid__ that `object displaces`
>> Applications of Principle to:
>> - Large floating vessels
>> - Submarines
>>> [!question] What is Buoyancy?
>>> Buoyancy is the upward force that fluids exert on objects, which aids in making the objects float
>>> The Buoyant Force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid !
>>
>>> [!example]
>>>Weight of Duck = 10 N
>>>Weight of Water Displaced = 15 N
>>> ---
>>>Weight of Rock = 40 N
>>>Weight of Water Displaced = 30 N
>>>The buoyant force pushing up on the rock is only 30 N because that is how much water was displaced by it.  
>>>The rock weighs 40 N.  30 N of force isn’t enough to hold up a 40 N object!
>>> ---

>>> A Hot-Air Balloon floats because the __weight of air displaced__ (=the buoyancy force) is greater than the ___weight of the balloon___

## Projectile Motion
>[!abstract] Projectile Motion
>`Objects` in __motion__ can have a path that lies in a plane. 
>This is called __two-dimensional motion__. 
>Examples are:
>-  flight of a batted baseball, 
>- a bullet fired or any object thrown into the air. 
> These are called __projectiles__ and the path the projectiles travels is an inverted parabola called it __trajectory__
> 
>> [!tip] Projectile Motion along the __Horizontal__
>> Along the horizontal, the projectile __moves in uniform motion__.
>> The horizontal component of the projectile’s velocity, 
>> ![[Pasted image 20240418064008.png]]
>> Where __θ__ is the angle of throw or projection usually measured along the horizontal, 
>> and __vi__ is the initial velocity of the projectile
