# Vectors

> [!abstract] Scalar and Vectors
> - A __SCALAR__ is a single number that __represents a magnitude__
> 	- E.g.: distance, mass, speed, temperature, etc.
> - A ___VECTOR___ is a set of numbers that describe ___both a MAGNITUDE and DIRECTION___
> 	- E.g.: velocity (the magnitude of velocity is speed), force, momentum, etc.
> - __Notation__: a vector-valued variable is differentiated from a scalar one by using ___bold___ or the following symbol:

>> [!tip] Characteristics of Vectors
>> A vector is something that has two and only two defining characteristics:
>> 1. __Magnitude__: the measure of 'quantity' that gives a number and its standard unit
>> 2. __Direction__: North, South, East, West
>
>> [!info] Direction (__Speed__ vs. ___Velocity___)
>> - Speed is __Scalar__, (magnitude no direction) - such as `5 meter per second` or `5 m/s`
>> 	- Speed __doesn't tell the direction__ the object is moving.
>> 		- Speed is the magnitude of the movement.
>> - Velocity, is a ___vector___ (both magnitude and direction) - such as `5 m/s East`.
>> 	- Tells the magnitude of the movement `5 m/s`, as well as the direction which is `Eastward`

> Quadrant 1 = Reference Angle (Θ)
> Quadrant 2 = 180 - Θ
> Quadrant 3 = 180 + Θ
> Quadrant 4 = 360 - Θ

> 	- `45 degrees` is the reference angle, we need the angle __relative to the `positive x-axis`__
> 		- which is `135` coz `180 - 45 = 135`
