## Truth Values of Logical Connectives
1. `Negation` ( *Not* ) - equal to the **opposite truth value** of the proposition

| p   | ~p  |
| --- | --- |
| `T`   | F   |
| `F`   | T   |
|     |     |

2. `Conjunction` ( *And* ) - only has a "TRUE" truth value **when both of the propositions are "TRUE"**. Otherwise, it has a "FALSE" truth value


| p   | q   | p ∧ q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| `T`   | `T`   | T     |
| `T`   | `F`    | F     |
| `F`    | `T`   | F     |
| `F`    | `F`    | F      |

3. `Disjunction` ( *Or* ) - has a "TRUE" truth value **when either one or both of the propositions has a "TRUE" truth value**. Otherwise, it has a "FALSE" truth value

| p   | q   | p ∨ q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| `T`  | `T`   | T     |
| `T`   | `F`    | T     |
| `F`    | `T`   | T     |
| `F`    | `F`    | F      |

4. `Implication` ( *If...Then...* ) - has a "FALSE" truth value **when the first proposition is "TRUE" and the second proposition is "FALSE"**. Otherwise, it has a "TRUE" truth value

| p   | q   | p → q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T`   | `T`   |  T   |
| `T`   | `F`    |   F  |
| `F`    | `T`   |    T |
| `F`    | `F`     |    T |


5. `Biconditional Statement` ( *If and only if* ) - has a "TRUE" truth value **when both propositions share the same truth value**. Otherwise, it has "FALSE" truth value



| p   | q   | p ↔ q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| `T`   | `T`   | T     |
| `T`   | `F`    | F     |
| `F`    | `T`   | F     |
| `F`    | `F`    | T     |

#### SUMMARY:

| p   | q   | ~p  | ~q  | p ∧ q | p ∨ q | p → q | p ↔ q |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `T`   | `T`   | F   | F   | T     | T     | T     | T     |
| `T`   | `F`    | F   | T   | F     | T     | F     | F     |
| `F`    | `T`   | T   | F   | F     | T     | T     | F     |
| `F`    | `F`    | T   | T   | F     | F     | T     | T     | 

###### EXAMPLES:
*TRUE and FALSE or TRUE*
1. (T **∧** F) **V** T
    = F **V** T
    = T

*if not TRUE then TRUE or FALSE*

2. **~** T  **→** (T **V** F)
    = F  **→** (T **V** F)
    = F **→** T
    = T

*not FALSE and TRUE if and only if not FALSE or FALSE*

1. **~** (F **∧** T) **↔** (**~** F **V** F)
    = **~** F **↔** (T **V** F)
    = T **↔** T
    = T
