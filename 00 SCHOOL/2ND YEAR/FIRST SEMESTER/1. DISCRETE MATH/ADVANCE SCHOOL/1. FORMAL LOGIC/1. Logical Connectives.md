# Logical Connectives
`Logical Connectives `are used to combine simple statements which are referred as compound statements.
*** 
1. <mark class="hltr-orange">Simple Proposition</mark> - a statement that conveys a single idea.
> `p` = Jonathan likes to play video games.
> `q` = Jonathan always stay up late

2. <mark class="hltr-orange">Compound Proposition</mark> - a statement that conveys two or more ideas.

#### Logical Connectives:
Consider the following propositions:
> `p` = Today is Sunday.
> `q` = The shop is closed.


1. <mark class="hltr-cyan">Negation</mark> - read as "`NOT`" and has a symbol `~`

>`~p` = Today is not Sunday.
>`~q` = The shop is not closed.

2. <mark class="hltr-cyan">Conjunction</mark> - read as "`AND`" and has a symbol `∧`
> `p`**∧**`q` = Today is Sunday and the shop is closed.

3. <mark class="hltr-cyan">Disjunction</mark> - read as "`or`" and has a symbol `∨`
> `p` **∨** `q` = Today is Sunday or the shop is closed.

CONDITIONALS:

4. <mark class="hltr-cyan">Implication</mark> - read as "`if...then...`" and has a symbol `→`
> `p` **→** `q` = If today is Sunday, then the shop is closed.

5. <mark class="hltr-cyan">Biconditional Statement</mark> - read as `if and only if` and has a symbol `↔`
>`p` **↔** `q` = Today is Sunday if and only if the shop is closed.

###### EXAMPLE:
Change the following propositions from symbol form to sentence form given:
> `p` = Joy watched the concert of Ben&Ben.
> `q` = Joy studies for the test.
> `r` = Joy is fully rested.
> `s` = Joy passed the test.

1. `p ∧ q`
    Joy watched the concert of Ben&Ben <mark class="hltr-grey">and</mark> Joy studies for the test.
2. `q ∨ r`
    Joy studies for the test <mark class="hltr-cyan">or</mark> she is fully rested
3. `~q`
    Joy does <mark class="hltr-blue">not</mark> study for the test.
4. `q → s`
     <mark class="hltr-grey"> If</mark> Joy studies for the test, <mark class="hltr-grey">then</mark> she will pass the test.
5. `s ↔ (q ∧ r)`
    Joy passed the test<mark class="hltr-cyan"> if and only if </mark> she studies for the test <mark class="hltr-cyan">and</mark> is fully rested.
6. `(~p ∧ r) → (q ∧ s)`
    <mark class="hltr-cyan">If</mark> Joy did <mark class="hltr-blue">not</mark> watch the concert of Ben&Ben <mark class="hltr-grey">and</mark> is fully rested, <mark class="hltr-cyan">then</mark> she studies for the test <mark class="hltr-grey">and</mark> passed the test.
