# Triangular Numbers
**Triangular numbers are those that can be written as the sum of a consecutive series of (whole) numbers beginning with 1. **

Thus 6 is triangular because it is the sum of the first three numbers: 
$$6 = 1 + 2 + 3. $$
The first few triangular numbers are **1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45,** and **55**. 

We denote the nth triangular number by **tn**. 
Thus t5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. 
More generally,
$$tn =1+2+3+...+ (n−2) + (n−1) + n$$
The nth triangular number is given by the formula:
