$P(\text{O blood type}) = \frac{\text{number of people with O blood type}}{\text{total number of people}} = \frac{70}{200} = \frac{7}{20}$

$\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$.

a. The probability of getting three heads in a row when tossing a fair coin is $\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$.

b. There are three possible outcomes that result in exactly one heads: HTHT, THTH, and THHT. Each of these outcomes has a probability of $\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$, so the probability of observing exactly one heads is $3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$.

c. There are three possible outcomes that result in at least two heads: HTHH, THHH, and HHHH. Each of these outcomes has a probability of $\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$, so the probability of observing at least two heads given that at least one head has been observed is $\frac{3}{8}$.

$3! \cdot 4! \cdot 3! \cdot 2! = 288 \cdot 144 = 41984$
