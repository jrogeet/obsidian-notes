# Control Statements - Conditional Statements
In Java, a statement is one or more lines of code ending with a semi-colon (;).

**Simple statement:**
▸ Basic building blocks of a program 
▸ One or more lines terminated by a semicolon (;)

**Compound Statement or Block:**
▸ Used to organize simple statements into complex structures 
▸ One or more statements enclosed by braces { } 
▸ Recommended to indent blocks for readability

## Control Structure

Control structures allow to change the ordering of how the statements in a program is executed 
⊳ Types of control structures: 

▸ **Decision control structures** 
▸ allow to select specific sections of code to be executed 

▸**Repetition control structures**
▸ allow to execute specific sections of the code a number of times

Java statements that allows a programmer to select and execute specific blocks of code while skipping other sections.

⊳ Include types such as: 
▸ If 
▸ If-Else 
▸ If-Else-If 
▸ Switch structure

## If statement
The simple if statement has the following syntax: 
```java
if(<boolean expression>)
	<statement action>
```

THE IF STATEMENT EXECUTES A BLOCK OF CODE ONLY IF THE SPECIFIED EXPRESSION IS TRUE

## If-else statement
Making a decision involves choosing between two alternative courses of action based on some value within a program.

## Nested-if Statement
A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if or else. Nested if statements means an if statement inside an if statement. Yes, java allows us to nest if statements within if statements. i.e, we can place an if statement inside another if statement

## Switch Case Statement
ALSO CALLED A CASE STATEMENT IS A MULTI-WAY BRANCH WITH SEVERAL CHOICES. 

A SWITCH IS EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THAN A SERIES OF IF/ELSE STATEMENTS.

# Looping Statements

## For-Loop
Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

## While Loop
 Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

## Do...While Loop
Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body

# Exception
An exception is an event, usually some form of error, which happens during the normal course of program execution. The object-oriented technique to manage such errors comprises the group of methods known as exception handling.
