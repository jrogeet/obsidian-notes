## Resistors
A resistor is **a passive two-terminal electrical component** that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.

##### Brief History on Resistors
- **Georg Ohm** was a German physicist and mathematician                                                                         He was known for his `“Ohm’s Law” `
    `Ohm’s Law` states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.

- The `resistor` was invented by **Otis Frank Boykin on 1959** He also invented a control unit for the artificial cardiac pacemaker He died because of heart failure on 1982

## Capacitors
A Capacitor is an **electronic component that stores electric charge.**
The capacitor is made of two close conductors (usually plates) that are separated by a dielectric material. The plates accumulate electric charge when connected to a power source. One plate accumulates positive charge and the other plate accumulates negative charge. 

**The capacitors are measured in Farads.**

#### Types of Capacitors
- Tantalum
- Aluminum
- Ceramic
- Trimmer
- Thin Film
## Transistors
A Transistor is a **three leg insect type component**, which is placed singly in some devices but in computers it is packed inside in millions of numbers in small microchips
##### Brief History About Transistors
 Before transistors, **first generation computers used vacuum tubes for logic circuitry.**

 The world’s first general-purpose electronic computer, ENIAC, had more than seventeen thousand vacuum tubes

 Vacuum tube cathodes are needed to be heated first to work. Because of this vacuum tubes are burnt out regularly and needed to be replaced.

 Because of the large number of vacuum tubes, the ENIAC was very power hungry

 The first transistors were developed by a group of scientists led by **John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley** at *AT&T Bell Laboratories in mid 1940s*
## Integrated Circuits or IC
An integrated circuit, or IC, is **a small chip that can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, microprocessor, or even a computer memory**

#### Types of IC's
- Digital Integrated Circuits
- Analog Integrated Circuits
- Mixed Integrated Circuits
- Logic Circuits
- Comparators
- Switching ICs
- Audio Amplifiers
- Operational Amplifiers
## Potentiometers
A potentiometer is **a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact** that forms an adjustable voltage divider.

 A potentiometer is a manually adjustable, variable resistor with three terminals. Two terminals are connected to a resistive element, the third terminal is connected to an adjustable wiper. The position of the wiper determines the output voltage.

#### Different Types of Potentiometers
 There are two major types of potentiometers, Rotary potentiometers and Linear Potentiometers

**Rotary potentiometers**  – The most common type of potentiometer where the wiper moves along a circular path.

**Linear potentiometers** - Potentiometers where the wiper moves along a linear path. Also known as slider, slide pot or fader.

## Diodes
A diode is **a two-terminal electrical device** that allows the transfer of current in only one direction.

 A diode is used for rectifying waveforms, within radio detectors or within power supplies.

 They can also be used in various electrical and electronic circuits where ‘one-way’ result of the diode is required.

 Most of the diodes are made from semiconductors like Si (silicon), but sometimes, Ge (germanium) is also used.

##### Brief History About Diodes
 The story of invention revolves around the perseverance of an American Physicist Russel S. Ohl who discovered the basic form of PN Junction while his research at Bell Laboratories.

 Russel Ohl (aka R.S Ohl) was a researcher with AT &T Bell laboratories who specialized in materials research.

#### Types of Diodes
- Gunn Diode
- LED
- PIN Diode
- Step Recovery Diode
- Laser Diode
- Photo Diode
- Schottky Diode
- Zener Diode
- Tunnel Diode
- Varactor Diode

## Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
An LED is a small component that gives light.

 To understand the workings of a light-emitting diode, you need to get into the physics part of semiconductors. Simply explained, the LED is similar to a standard diode, but with the addition of a phenomenon called Electroluminescence.

##### Connecting an LED
 The LED has two pins called anode and cathode.

 The anode is the longest pin. This is the pin you connect to the most positive voltage. The cathode is the pin you connect to the most negative voltage. They must be connected correctly for the LED to work.

## Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)
An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing circuits

Light dependent resistors or photoresistors, are sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity

###### Some Applications of LDRs
 There are many applications for Light Dependent Resistors. These include:

**** Lightning Switch***

 The most obvious application for an LDR is to automatically turn on a light at a certain light level. An example of this could be a street light or a garden light.

**** Camera shutter control***
 LDRs can be used to control the shutter speed on a camera. The LDR would be used to measure the light intensity which then adjusts the camera shutter speed to the appropriate level.

## Button Switch
A Button is a **simple switch mechanism** for controlling some aspect of a machine or a process.

 Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal. The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed.

 Buttons are most often biased switch, although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a spring to return to their un-pushed state.
## Relays
Relays are switches that open and close circuits electromagnetically or electronically

#### Some TYPES of Relays
 A type of relay that can handle the high power required to directly control an electric motor or other loads is called a contactor.

 `Solid-state relays` control power circuits with no moving parts, instead using a semiconductor device to perform switching.

` Magnetic latching relays` require one pulse of coil power to move their contacts in one direction, and another, redirected pulse to move them back. Repeated pulses from the same input have no effect. Magnetic latching relays are useful in applications where interrupted power should not be able to transition the contacts.



## Multimeters
A multimeter is **also known as a volt-ohm meter**, is a handheld tester used to measure electrical voltage, current(amperage), resistance, and other values.

#### Types of Multimeters
` Analog multimeters` use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings.

` Digital multimeters` (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value.
