**CONDUCTOR** - Copper Wire, conducts electricity
**INSULATOR** - Rubber/Plastic Layer, doesn't conduct electricity

**SEMI-CONDUCTOR** - Between Conductor and Insulator, would not be a good Conductor and Insulator
but we can manufacture it such that it can be a good Conductor or Insulator.

You can switch it from being a good Conductor or Insulator with an Electrical signal
MOST digital electronics and Semi-conductor are made from SILICONE
