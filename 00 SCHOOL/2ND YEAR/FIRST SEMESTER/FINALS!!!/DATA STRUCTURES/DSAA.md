# Infix, Prefix, Postfix Notation

Three different ways of writing equivalent expressions


Examples:
**Infix** - A * (B  + C) / D

**Postfix** - A B C + * D /
Operators occur after the operrand

**Prefix** - / * A + B C D
Operators occur before the operrand


**INFIX** : From our schools times we have been familiar with the expressions in which operands surround the operator, e.g. x+y, 6*3 etc this way of writing the Expressions is called infix notation.



**POSTFIX**: Postfix notation are also Known as **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**. They are different from the infix and prefix notations in the sense that in the postfix notation, operator comes after the operands, e.g. xy+, xyz+* etc.




**PREFIX** : Prefix notation also Known as **Polish notation**.In the prefix notation, as the name only suggests, operator comes before the operands, e.g. +xy, *+xyz etc.

## Strict/Proper binary tree
Each node can have either 2 or 0 children

## Complete Binary tree
All levels except possibly the last are completely filled and all nodes as left as possible
