# What is ETHICS?
- Ethics was taken from the Greek word `ethos` which means `customs`, `usage` `characteristic`, thus, the term ethics is expressed in various ways of understanding and examining the moral life of the person as it is cited **by Beauchamp and Childress (1994).**
- It is a branch of philosophy that is a philosophical enterprise that investigates and questions the way or the nature of human actions, see if it has a ground so that is supports its own moral claim.
- Ethics investigates or studies morality.


IT IS NOT JUST ANY ACTION OF MAN,
RATHER, AND ACTION THAT IS GEARED TOWARDS WHAT IS CONSIDERED MORAL, NAMELY, HUMAN ACTION.

Acts of Human vs. Human Acts
1. **Acts of Human** - These are processes that **do not require a decision-making action from a person.** They happen naturally in the body, without a person's being conscious about them. Acts of Human is neither right or wrong.
2. **Human Acts** - These are actions that require a person to make a choice, use utmost responsibility, and use his/her conscience. Human Acts can either be right or wrong.

Examples of **ACTS OF HUMAN**:
1. Breathing
2. Beating of the heart
3. Perspiration
4. Growing of the hair
5. Growing of the nails

- Looking
- Seeing
- Dreaming
- Day dreaming
- Hearing
- Listening
- Walking
- Sleepwalking

Examples of **Human Acts:**
1. Telling the truth
2. Giving money to the poor
3. Returning a lost item

The ethical dimension of Human Existence
Ethics as a subject for us to study is about determining the gorunds for the values w/ particular and special significance to **HUMAN LIFE.**

**Aesthetic** means Art and Beauty
**Etiquette** is not *Ethics*

- It shows us that aesthetic considerations and questions of ETIQUETTE are important facets of human life. *But they do not necessarily translate into genuine ethical or moral value.*
- **THE CHOISE OF CLOTHING THAT ONE IS TO WEAR,** in general, seems to be *merely a question of aesthetics*, and thus one is taste.
- Yet in some cultures, what a woman wears (or does not wear) may bring upon harsh punishment to her according to the community's rule.
- Afghanistan in the 1990s was ruled by Taliba, and women were expected to wear the full-body burga; a woman caught in public with even a small area of her body exposed could be flogged serverely.

TECHNICAL VALUATIONS

##### NORMATIVE ETHICS
- Normative approach is an evaluative one, it is **a way of generating and FORMULATING PRINCIPLES, RULES, STANDARDS THAT WILL GUIDE HUMAN CONDUCT OR ACTION.**
- In normative approach it includes general normative ethics and applied ethics. The former emphasizes any philosophical attempt to formulate and to defend basic moral principles and virtues governing the moral life, thus, it emphasizes ETHICAL THEORIES like natural law theory, utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics etc. 
- The PRINCIPLES found in normative general ethics that are regarded to be of help to guide an action and are commonly applied to some specific moral problems such as in medicine, nursing and other medical sciences; thus, it yields an APPLIED ETHICS

##### NON-NORMATIVE ETHICS
- This approach is a non-evaluative one. IT SIMPLY CONSIDERS BY KNOWING WHAT IT IS AND DESCRIBES CERTAIN ACITONS

# Ethical Subjectivism
2 Types of Subjectivism:
- Normative Subjectivism
- Meta-Ethical Subjectivism
***
### Normative Subjectivism
- According to normative subjectivism, **an act is morally right if, and only if, the person judging the action approves it**.
- Normative subjectivism allows that moral judgements can be true or false. There is truth in ethics, but no objective truth. A moral judgment is true just in case it accurately reports the sentiments of the speaker.
- Sincerity is the mark of ethical truth. If normative subjectivism is true, then one's sincere moral judgmets cannot be mistaken.
<br>
- When someone utters the phrase "Murder is wrong," what they say is true if, and only if, they actually disapprove of murder.
- When someone utters the phrase "Murder is right," what they say is true if, and only if, they actually approve of murder.
![[Pasted image 20220907081043.png]]
> In this case, if both speakers are honestly expressing their beliefs, then what each person

- On normative subjectivism. some moral judgments can be false. A moral judgment would be false if the speaker who utters it is not honestly reporting his or her beliefs. For example, if one lies about what they approve or disapprove of, then they're statement would be false.
> For example, if a man lies about his ethical views because he thinks that's what his audience wants to hear, then what he has said is false.
#### An Argument for NORMATIVE SUBJECTIVISM
- The argument from disagreement:
1. There is persistent disagreement about moral matters. disagreement that cannot be rationally resolved.
2. The best explanation for such persistent, unresolvable disagreement is that there is no objective truth about moral matters.
3. Moral judgments can nevertheless be true or false
4. Therefore, the truth or falsity of moral judgments is not objective, but depends on the attitudes of those making the judgments.

#### Objections to the Argument
- Most of the objections to this argument are going to focus  on premise 2: the best explanation premise.
- One might think that the best eplanation of moral disagreement is that we haven't enough information to settle the issue yet.
> There was a time when people disagreed about the shape of the Earth, whether the Earth rotated around the sun or vice versa, and many other issues. Ethics, the objection goes, may be just like these disagreements.

## Meta-ethical Subjectivism
- Meta-ethical subjectivism is not a normative view; it makes a claim about normative views.
- Meta-ethical subjectivism claims that normative ethical theories, and moral judgments in general, cannot be true.
> Note: meta-ethical subjectivism implies the falsity of normative subjectivism, and vice versa.

<br>
- According to meta-ethical subjectivism, the purpose of moral judgment is not to report personal or social attitudes, but rather to express one's feelings or voice one's commitments.
- For instance, when one says, "infanticide is wrong," even though this looks like a statement that could be true or false, it is in fact just an expression of dislike or dissatisfacetion with infanticide. It would be like saying "Boo infanticide" or "I don't linke infanticide."
> These things can't be true or false becuase emotive expressions and likes/dislikes can't be true or flase.

#### An Argument for Meta-Ethical Subjectivism
- The argument from moral motivation:
1. Every moral judgment motivates all by itself.
2. Factual judgments cannot motivate all by themselves.
3. Therefore moral judgments are not factual judgments.
- Premise 1 claims that moral judgments are motivational. This means that to judge and action right is to be motivated to perform it. Similarly, to judge a action wrong, is to be motivated to not perform it.
> If one judges that eating animas is wrong, then such a person must be motivated to not eat animals.

- Premise 2 claims that factual judgments cannot motivate by themselves. This means that beliefs, in and of themselves, cannot move us to act. In order to act, we must be motivated by a desire of some sort.
> For EXAMPLE, we believe all sorts of mathematical, chemical, and physical propositions without be moved at all. And when we are moved by factual judgments it seems to be because there is also some accompanying desire.

#### Objections to the Argument
- Shafer-Landau notes that premise 2 is widely accepted as true, so most of the attack o nthis argument will be on premise 1.
- It's open to objectors to claim that moral judgments are factual claims-- claims that express beliefs-- and so could be true or false AND not be able to motivate.

# Ethical Egoism
- The idea that each person ought to pursue his/her own self-interest exclusively
- It differs from Psychological Egoism which is a theory of human nature concerned with how people do behave
- Ethical Egoism by contrast is a normative theory (a theory about how we ought to behave)
- It argues we have no duty except to do what is best for ourselves
- There is only one ultimate principle of conduct - the principle of self-interest
- All duties and obligations are subject to self-interest
##### Important
- Ethical Egoism does not say that you should avoid actions that help others
- It could be that by helping others you help yourself
- 'You scratch my back and i'll scratch yours'
- Or your interests coincide with interests of others and by helping yourself you inadvertently help others
- The important point is that in such cases the benefit to others is not what makes the action right
#### Selfishness not foolishness
- It is also important to realise it doesn't endorse the idea that we ought alsways to do what we want to
- Short term pleasures may be harmful in the long run
- It doesn't lead to a debauched hedonistic lifestyle
- It says that a person really ought to do what really is in his/her own best advantage over the long run - **It endorses selfishness not foolishness**
### Two arguments in support of Ethical Egoism
A. Each of us is intimately familiar with out own individual needs and wants but we cannot know the desires and need of other people
B. The policy of looking out for others is an offensive intrusion into other people's privacy
C. Making other people the object of one's 'charity' is degrading to them it robs them of their dignity and self-respect

## Value of the human individual
- Rand is arguing along these lines
- A person has only one life to live. If we value the individual - that is, if the individual has moral worth - then we must agree that this life is of supreme importance
- If your willing to sacrifice for the good of others (altruism) you are not truly valuing the human individual
- Therefore Ethical Egoism is the philosophy that ought to be accepted

### James Rachels - Two arguments against Ethical Egoism
1. Rachels argues that... Ethical Egoism cannot provide solutions for conflicts of interest
- We need moral rules because our interests some times come into conflict
2. Ethical Egoism advocates that each of us divides the world into two categories of people - ourselves and the rest - and we regard the interests of the first group as more important than the interests of the second group.
- But what is the difference between myself and other that justifies placing myself in this special category
- Am i more intelligent?
- Do i enjoy my life more?
- Are my achievements greater?
- What makes me so special?
- Failing an answer Ethical Egoism is an arbitrary doctrine

1. "THE INDIVIDUAL IS THE SOLE DETERMINANT OF WHAT IS MORALLY GOOD OR BAD, RIGHT OR WRONG."
a. LAW
b. RELATIVISM
c.RELIGION
d.SUBJECTIVISM

theory that describes the underlying dynamic behind all human actions
answer: psychological egoism



# Model for Ethical Decision Making

1. **GATHER THE FACTS** - Frequently ethical dilemmas can be resolved simply by clarifying the facts of the case in question. In those cases that prove to be more difficult, gathering the facts is the essential first step prior to any ethical analysis and reflection on the case. In analyzing a case, we want to know the available facts  at hand as well as any facts currently not known but that need to be ascertained.  Thus one is asking not only “What do we know?” but also “ What do we need to know?” in order to make an intelligent ethical decision.

2. DETERMINE THE ETHICAL ISSUES

The ethical issues are stated in terms of competing interests or goods. It’s these conflicting interests that actually make for an ethical dilemma. The issues should be presented ia a ______versus _________ format in order to reflect the interests that are colliding in a particular ethical dilemma. For example, in business ethics there is often a conflict between the right of a firm to make profit and its obligation to the community. In this case, the obligation pertains to the environment

3. WHAT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES HAVE A BEARING ON THE CASE

-   In any ethical dilemma, there are certain moral values or principles that are central to the conflicting positions being taken. It is critical to identify these principles, and in some cases, to determine whether some principles are to be weighted more heavily than others. Clearly, biblical principles will be weighted the most heavily. There may be other principles that speak to the case that come from other sources.  There may be constitutional principles or principles drawn from natural law that supplement the biblical principles that come into play here.  The principles that come out of your mission and calling are also important to consider.

4.  LIST THE ALTERNATIVES

-   -   Part of the creative thinking involved in resolving an ethical dilemma involves coming up with various alternative courses of action. Although there will be some alternatives that you will rule out without much thought, in general the more alternatives that are listed, the better the chance that your list will include some high-quality ones. In addition, you may come up with some very creative alternative that you had not considered before.

5. COMPARE THE ALTERNATIVES WITH THE PRINCIPLES

At this point, the task is one of eliminating alternatives according to the moral principles that have a bearing on the case. In many instances, the case will be resolved at this point, since the principles will eliminate all alternatives except one. In fact, the purpose of this comparison is to see if there is a clear decision that can be made without further deliberations.  If a clear decision is not forthcoming, then the next part is the model that must be considered. At the least, some of the alternatives may be eliminated by this step of comparison.

6, WEIGH THE CONSEQUENCES

  If the principles do not yield a clear decision, then a consideration of the consequences of the remaining available alternatives is in order.  Both positive and negative consequences are to be considered. They should be informally weighed, since some positive consequences are more detrimental than others.

7. MAKE A DECISION

-   Deliberations cannot go on forever. At some point, a decision must be made. Realize that one common element in ethical dilemmas is that there are no easy and painless solutions to them.  Frequently the decision that is made is one that involves the least number of problems or negative consequences, not one that is devoid of them.

# Lawrence Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development

**Lawrence** **Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development.**

In recent years, psychologist looked at many of the same question asked by philosophers have pondered but from their own professional perspective. Psychologist’s theories of moral development provide an insight into how moral disagreement developed and even how they untangle it.

Lawrence Kohlberg, a professor of psychology in Harvard University is a prominent moral development theorist, but his thinking grew out of Jean Piaget’s writing on children’s intellectual development. His theory is descriptive, rather than, proven facts.

Kohlberg presumes that there are six stages of moral development that people go through in much the same way as infants learned first to role over, to sit, to crawl, to stand and finally to walk. Kohlberg clearly emphasized the following system of his theory:

1.  Everyone goes through each stage in the same order, but not everyone goes through all the stages and
2.  A person at one stage can understand the reasoning of any stage below him but cannot understand more than one stage above.

These correlates, especially the latter one, are important when it comes to assessing the nature of disagreement about ethical judgment. Perhaps the easiest way is to remember them is by differing kinds of justification involved in each stage. There are three levels in his theory and each level is divided into stages. The schema will show the stages of moral development:

1.  **Pre-conventional level**

_(pre-conventional because individuals do not yet speak as members of society, instead they see morality as something external to themselves)_

**Stage**

**Description**

**Content**

**Social Perspective**

**Stage 1**

**Punishment**

**and**

**Obedience**

The first stage is characterized by a view that right action is to behave according to social acceptable norms imposed by some authority figure (e.g., parent, teacher) in order to avoid punishment.

Right is a literal obedience to rules and authority, avoiding punishment, and not doing physical harm. What is right is to avoid breaking rules, to obey for obedience’s sake and to avoid physical damage to people and authority. Thus follow and obey because of the consequence of punishment and due to superior power of authorities.

This stage takes an egocentric point of view, a person at this stage does not consider the interests of others and does not relate two points of view. Actions were justified in terms of physical consequence rather in terms psychological interests of others. Authority’s perspective is confused with one’s own.

**Stage 2**

**Individual**

**And instrumental exchange**

Is characterized by a view that right behavior means acting in one’s own best interests.

What is right is following rules when it is to someone’s immediate interest. Right is acting to meet one’s interests and needs and letting others do the same. Right  is also what is fair, that is, what is an equal exchange, a deal, am agreement. The reason for doing what is right is to serve one’s own needs/interests in a world where one must recognize that other people have their interests as well.

This stage takes a concrete  individualistic perspective. A person at this stage separates his own interests and points of view from those of authorities and others.  The person integrates or relates conflicting individual interests to one another through instrumental exchange of service, need for others and other’s goodwill. Perhaps through fairness giving each person the same amount.

1.  **Conventional Level**

_(it speaks on isolated individuals rather than as members of the society. It sees individual exchanging favors, but there is still no identification with the values of the family/community)_

**Stage 3**

**Mutual**

**and**

**interpersonal**

**conformity**

Characterized by an attitude which one seeks to do that will gain the approval of others.

It sees what is right is living up according to the expectations by people that are close to them, like the family, community. Being good and having good behavior means having good motives and interpersonal feelings such as empathy, love, trust, concern.

This stage takes the perspective of the individual in relationship to other individuals. Thus, a person in this stage is aware of the shared feelings, agreement and expectations that take primacy over the individual interests.

**Stage 4**

**Law**

**And**

**Order**

Is characterized by abiding the law and respecting authority and performing one’s duty so that social order is maintained.

What is right is fulfilling one’s own duty to which one had agreed. The reasons for doing what is right are to keep the institutions going as a whole.

This stage differentiates societal point of view from interpersonal agreement or motives. A person at this stage takes the viewpoint of the system, which defines roles and rules, individual relations in terms of one’s own place in the system.

1.  **Post-conventional level**

_(moral decisions are generated from the rights, values or principles that are or that could be agreeable to all individuals composing or creating a society designed to have fair and beneficial practices)_

**Stage 5**

**Social contract**

**And**

**Individual rights**

Is characterized by thinking about a society in a very theoretical way, stepping back from their own established society and considering the rights and values of the society ought to uphold.

What is right is the awareness of the fact that people hold a variety of values and opinion that most values and rules are relative to one’s group. The reason for doing what is right, is in general, feeling obligated to obey the law, because one has made a social contract to make and abide by laws for the good of all and to protect their own rights and the rights of others. Like, family, friend. One is concerned that laws and duties be based from a rational calculation of the overall ‘utility’. ‘The greatest good for the greatest number’

This stage takes a ‘prior-to-society’ perspective. It means that individuals are aware of the values and rights prior to social attachment and contract. The person integrates perspective by formal mechanism of agreement, contract, objective impartiality and due process.

**Stage 6**

**Universal ethical**

**principles**

Is characterized by an attitude of respect for universal principle and the demands of individual conscience.

The right action on this stage is guided by universal ethical principles, particularly law, social agreement are usually valid because it is anchored to principles. When law perhaps violates the universal principle one is often acts in accordance with the principle. The principle of equality, justice, respect and others. These are not only values but regarded as principle that is of used in order to generate decisions.

This stage takes the perspective that a person takes a stand in view of moral principle from which social agreement are derived on which they are grounded.

### External Authority
1. **LAW (STATE)** - *NOT ALL LEGAL IS MORAL, AND NOT ALL MORAL IS LEGAL*
2. **RELIGION (FAITH)** - MULTIPLICITY of religion

##### JAMES RACHELS (1941 - 2003)
- Rachels defines CULTURAL RELATIVISM AS THE POSITION THAT CLAIMS THAT **THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OBJECTIVE TRUTH IN THE REALM OF MORALITY.**
- The argument of this position is that since different cultures have different moral codes, then THERE
### Internal Authority



**EGO means I** (or Me)




# LAW, RELIGION and CULTURE

-   **LAW** - It is supposed the law is one’s guide to ethical behavior. In the Philippines, Filipinos are constrained to obey the laws of the land as stated in country’s criminal and civil codes. The term positive law refers to the different rules and regulations that are posited or put forward by an authority figure that require compliance.
-   **RELIGION** –
    
    **Does Morality Depend on Religion?**
    
    by James Rachels
    
    (Chapter 4 of Rachels, The Elements of Morality 6th ed)
    
    “The Good consists in always doing what God wills at any particular moment”.
    
    Emil Brunner, The Divine Imperative (1947)
    
    “I respect deities. I do not rely upon them.”
    
    Musashi Miyamoto, at Ichijohi Temple (CA. 1608)
    
    1.   **The Presumed Connection between Morality and Religion**
    
    In 1987 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Judge Roy Moore of Gadsden, Alabama, for displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. Such a display, it said, violates the separation of church and state. The ACLU may not have liked Moore, but Alabama voters did. I 2000, Moore successfully campaigned to become chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, running on the premise to “restore the moral foundation of law.” Thus the “Ten Commandments Judge became the most powerful jurist in the state of Alabama.
    
    Moore was not through making his point, however. In the wee hours of July 31, 2001, he had a granite monument to the ten Commandments installed in the Alabama state judicial building. This monument weighed over five thousand pounds, and was anyone entering the building could not miss it. Moore was sued again, but the people were behind him: 77% of Americans thought that he should be allowed to display his monument. Yet the law did not agree. When Moore disobeyed a court order to remove it, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary fired him, saying that he had placed himself above the law. Moore, however, believed that he was putting God above the law.
    
    Few people, at least in the United States, would find this remarkable. Among western democracies, the U.S. is an unusually religious country. Nine out of ten Americans say they believe in a personal God; in Denmark and Sweden, the figure is only one in five. It is not unusual for priests and ministers to be treated as moral experts. Most hospitals, for example, have ethics committees, and these committees usually include three types of members: healthcare professionals to advise about technical matters, lawyers to handle legal issues, and religious representatives to address the moral questions. When newspapers want comments about the ethical dimensions of a story, they call upon the clergy, and the clergy are happy to oblige. Priests and ministers are assumed to be wise counselors who will give sound moral advice when it is needed.
    
    Why are clergymen regarded this way? The reason is not that they have proven to be better or wiser than other people - as a group, they seem to be neither better nor worse than the rest of us. There is a deeper reason why they are regarded as having special moral insight. In popular thinking, morality and religion are inseparable: People commonly believe that morality can be understood only in the context of religion. So because the clergymen are the spokesmen for religion, it is assumed that they must be spokesmen for morality as well.
    
    It is not hard to see why people think this. When viewed from a nonreligious perspective, the universe seems to be a cold, meaningless place, devoid of value and purpose. In his essay, A Free Man’s Worship, written in 1902, Bertrand Russell expressed what he called the scientific view of the world:
    
    _That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man’s achievement must inevitable be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins - all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul’s habitation henceforth be safely built._
    
    From a religious perspective, however, things look very different. Judaism and Christianity teach that the world was created by a loving, all-powerful God to provide a home for us. We, in turn, were created in his image, to be his children. Thus the world is not devoid of meaning and purpose. It is, instead, the arena in which God’s plans and purposes are realized. What could be more natural, then, than to think that morality is a part of the religious view of the world, whereas the atheist’s world has no place for values?
    
    2.  **The Divine Command Theory**
    
    In the major theistic traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, God is conceived as a lawgiver who has laid down rules that we are to obey. He does not compel us to obey them. We were created as free agents, so we may choose to accept or to reject his commandments. But if we are to live as we should live, we must follow God’s laws. This conception has been elaborated by some theologians into a theory about the nature of right and wrong known as the Divine Command Theory. Essentially, this theory says that morally right means commanded by God and morally wrong means forbidden by God.
    
    This theory has a number of attractive features. It immediately solves the old problem about the objectivity of ethics. Ethics is not merely a matter of personal feeling or social custom. Whether something is right or wrong is perfectly objective: It is right if God commands it, wrong if God forbids it. Moreover, the Divine Command Theory suggests an answer to the perennial question of why anyone should bother with morality. Why not forget about ethics and just look out for oneself? If immorality is the violation of God’s commandments, there is an easy answer: On the day of final reckoning, you will be held accountable.
    
    There are, however, serious problems for the theory, Of course, atheists would not accept it, because thy do no believe that God exists. But there are difficulties even for believers. The main problem was first noted by Plato, the Greek Philosopher who lived 400 years before the birth of Jesus.
    
    Plato’s writings were in the form of dialogues, usually between Socrates and one or more interlocutors. In one of these dialogues, the Euthyphro, there is a discussion concerning whether right can be defined as that which the gods command. Socrates is skeptical and asks: Is conduct right because the gods command it, or do the gods command it because it is right? This is one of the most famous questions in the history of philosophy. The British philosopher Antony Flew suggests that one good test of a person’s aptitude for philosophy is to discover whether he can grasp its force and point.
    
    The point is that if we accept the theological conception of right and wrong, we are caught in a dilemma. Socrates question asks us to clarify what we mean. There are two things we might mean, and both lead to trouble.
    
    1.  First, we might mean that right conduct is right because God commands it. For example, according to Exodus 20:16, God commands us to be truthful. On this option, the reason we should be truthful is simply that God requires it. Apart from the divine command, truth telling is neither good nor bad. It is God’s command that makes truthfulness right.
    
    But this leads to trouble, for it represents God’s commands as arbitrary. It means that God could have given different commands just as easily. He could have commanded us to be liars, and then lying, not truthfulness, would be right. (You may be tempted to reply: But God would never command us to lie. But why not? If he did endorse lying, God would not be commanding us to do wrong, because his command would make it right.) Remember that on this view, honesty was not right before God commanded it. Therefore, he could have had no more reason to command it than its opposite; and so, from a moral point of view, his command is arbitrary.
    
    Another problem is that, on this view, the doctrine of the goodness of God is reduced to nonsense. It is important to religious believers that God is not only all-powerful and all-knowing, but the he is also good; yet if we accept the idea that good and bad are defined by reference to God’s will, this notion is deprived of any meaning. What could it mean to say that God’s commands are good? If X is good means X is commanded by God then God’s commands are good would mean only God’s commands are commanded by God, an empty truism. In 1686, Leibniz observed in his Discourse on Metaphysics:
    
    So in saying that things are not good by any rule of goodness, but sheerly by the will of God, it seems to me that one destroys, without realizing it, all the love of God and all his glory. For why praise him for what he has done if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing exactly the contrary?
    
    Thus, if we choose the first of Socrates two options, we seem to be stuck with consequences that even the most religious people would find unacceptable.
    
    Unfortunately, however, this second option leads to a different problem, which is equally troublesome. In taking this option, we have abandoned the theological conception of right and wrong - when we say that God commands us to be truthful because truthfulness is right, we are acknowledging a standard of right and wrong that is independent of God’s will. The rightness exists prior to and independent of God’s command, and it is the reason for the command. Thus, if we want to know why we should be truthful, the reply Because God commands it does not really tell us, for we may still ask But why does God command it? and the answer to that question will provide the underlying reason why truthfulness is a good thing.
    
    All this may be summarized in the following argument:
    
    1.  Suppose God commands us to do what is right. Then either (a) the right actions are right because he commands them or (b) he commands them because they are right.
    
    2.  If we take option (a), the God’s commands are, from a moral point of view, arbitrary; moreover, the doctrine of the goodness of God is rendered meaningless.
    
    3.  If we take option (b), then we will have acknowledged a standard of right and wrong that is independent of God’s will. We will have, in effect, given up the theological conception of right and wrong.
    
    4.  Therefore, we must either regard God’s commands as arbitrary, and give up the doctrine of the goodness of God, or admit that there is a standard of right and wrong that is independent of his will, and give up the theological conception of right and wrong.
    
    5.  From a religious point of view, it is unacceptable to regard God’s commands as arbitrary or to give up the doctrine of the goodness of God.
    
    6.  Therefore, even from a religious point of view, a standard of right and wrong that is independent of God’s will must be accepted.
    
    Many religious people believe that they must accept a theological conception of right and wrong because it would be impious no to do so. They feel, somehow, that if they believe in God, they should say that right and wrong are to be defined in terms of his will. But this argument suggests otherwise: It suggests that, on the contrary, the Divine Command Theory itself leads to impious results, so that a devout person should not accept it. And in fact, some of the greatest theologians, such as St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), rejected the theory for just this reason. Thinkers such as Aquinas connect morality with religion in a different way.
    
    **3. Religion and moral issues**
    
    Some religious people will find the preceding discussion unsatisfying. It will seem too abstract to have any bearing on their actual moral lives. For them, the connection between morality and religion is an immediate, practical matter that centers on particular moral issues. It doesn’t matter whether right and wrong are defined in terms of God’s will or whether moral laws are laws of nature: Whatever the merits of such theories, there are still the moral teachings of one’s religion about particular issues. The teachings of the Scriptures and the church are regarded as authoritative, determining the moral positions one must take. To mention only one example, many Christians think that they have no choice but to oppose abortion because it is condemned both by the church and (they assume) by the Scriptures.
    
    Are there, in fact, distinctively religious positions on major moral issues, which believer are bound to accept? If so, are those positions different from the views that other people might reach simply by trying to reason out the best thing to do? The rhetoric of the pulpit suggests that the answer to both questions is yes. But there are several reasons to think otherwise.
    
    In the first place, it is often difficult to find specific moral guidance in the Scriptures. Our problems are not the same as the problems faced by the Jews and the early Christians many centuries ago; thus, it is not surprising that the Scriptures might be silent about moral issues that seem urgent to us. The Bible contains a number of general precepts, such a the injunctions to love one’s neighbor and to treat others as one would wish to be treated oneself, that might be thought relevant to a variety of issues. But worthy as those precepts are, they do not yield definite answers about exactly what position one should take concerning the rights of workers, the extinction of species, the funding of medical research, and so on.
    
    Another problem is that in many instances the Scriptures and church tradition are ambiguous. Authorities disagree, leaving the believer in the awkward position of having to choose which element of the tradition to accept and which authority to believe. Read plainly, for example, the New Testament condemns being rich, and there is a long tradition of self-denial and charitable giving that affirms this teaching. But there is also an obscure Old Testament figure named Jabez who asked God to enlarge my territories (I Chronicles 4:10), and God did. A recent book urging Christians to adopt Jabez as their model became a best-seller.
    
    Thus when people say that their moral views are derived from their religious commitments, they are often mistaken. In reality, something very different is going on. They are making up their minds about the moral issues first and then interpreting the Scriptures, or church tradition, in such a way as to support the moral conclusion they have already reached. Of course this does not happen in every case, but it seems fair to say that it happens often. The question of riches is one example; abortion is another.
    
    In the debate over abortion, religious issues are never far from the center of discussion. Religious conservatives hold that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception, and so they say killing it is really a form of murder. They do not believe it should be the mother’s choice whether to have an abortion, because that would be like saying she is free to commit murder.
    
    The key premise in the conservative argument is that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception. The fertilized ovum is not merely a potential human being but an actual human being with a full-fledged right to life. Liberals, of course, deny this - they say that, at least during the early weeks of pregnancy, the embryo is something less than a full human being.
    
    The debate over the humanity of the fetus is enormously complicated, but here we are concerned with just one small part of it. Conservative Christians sometimes say that, regardless of how secular thought might view the fetus, the Christian view is that the fetus is a human being from its very beginning. But is this view mandatory for Christians? What evidence might be offered to show this? One might appeal to the Scriptures or to church tradition.
    
    The Scriptures. It is difficult to derive a prohibition of abortion from either the Jewish or the Christian Scriptures. The Bible does not speak plainly on the matter. There are certain passages, however, that are often quoted by conservatives because they seem to suggest that fetuses have full human status. One of the most frequently cited passages is from the first chapter of Jeremiah, in which God is quoted as saying: Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you. These words are presented as though they were God’s endorsement of the conservative positions: They are taken to mean that the unborn, as well as the born, are consecrated to God.
    
    In context, however, these words obviously mean something quite different. Suppose we read the whole passage in which they occur:
    
    Now the word of the Lord came to me saying, Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.
    
    Then I said, Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth. But the Lord said to me,
    
    Do not say I am only a youth for to all to whom I send you you shall go, and whatever I command you you shall speak. Be not afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.
    
    Neither abortion, the sanctity of fetal life, nor anything else of the kind is being discussed in this passage. Instead, Jeremiah is asserting his authority as a prophet. He is saying, in effect, God authorized me to speak for him; even though I resisted, he commanded me to speak. But Jeremiah puts the point more poetically; he has God saying that God had intended him to be a prophet even before Jeremiah was born.
    
    This often happens when the Scriptures are cited in connection with controversial moral issues. A few words are lifted from a passage that is concerned with something entirely different from the issue at hand, and those words are then construed in a way that supports a favored moral position. When this happens, is it accurate to say that the person is following the moral teachings of the Bible? Or is it more accurate to say the he or she is searching the Scriptures for support of a moral view he or she already happens to think is right, and reading the desired conclusion into the Scriptures? If the latter, it suggests an especially impious attitude - an attitude that assumes God himself must share one’s own moral opinions. In the case of the passage from Jeremiah, it is hard to see how an impartial reader could think the words have anything to do with abortion, even by implication.
    
    The scriptural passage that comes closest to making a specific judgment about the moral status of fetuses occurs in the 21st chapter of Exodus. This chapter is part of a detailed description of the law of the ancient Israelites. Here the penalty for murder is said to be death; however, it is also said that if a pregnant woman is caused to have a miscarriage, the penalty is only a fine, to be paid by her husband. Murder was not a category that included fetuses. The Law of Israel apparently regarded fetuses as something less than full human beings.
    
    Church Tradition. Even if there is little scriptural basis for it, the contemporary church’s stand is strongly antiabortion. The typical churchgoer will hear ministers, priests, and bishops denouncing abortion in the strongest terms. It is no wonder, then, that many people feel that their religious commitment binds them to oppose abortion.
    
    But it is worth noting that the church has not always taken this view. In fact, the idea that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception is a relatively new idea, even within the Christian church. St. Thomas Aquinas held that an embryo does not have a soul until several weeks into the pregnancy. Aquinas accepted Aristotle’s view that the soul is the substantial form of man. We need not go into this somewhat technical notion, except to note that one implication is that one cannot have a human soul until one’s body has a recognizably human shape. Aquinas knew that a human embryo does not have a human shape from the moment of conception, and he drew the indicated conclusion. Aquinas’s view of the matter was officially accepted by the church at the Council of Vienne in 1312, and to this day it has never been officially repudiated.
    
    However, in the 17th century, a curious view of fetal development came to be accepted, and this has unexpected consequences for the church’s view of abortion. Peering through primitive microscopes at fertilized ova, some scientists imagined that they saw tiny, perfectly formed people. They called the little person a homunculus, and the idea took hold that from the very beginning the human embryo is a fully formed creature that needs only to get bigger and bigger until it is ready to be born.
    
    If the embryo has a human shape from the moment of conception, then it follows, according to Aristotle’s and Aquinas’s philosophy, that it can have a human soul from the moment of conception. The church drew this conclusion and embraced the conservative view of abortion. The homunculus, it said, is clearly a human being, and so it is wrong to kill it.
    
    However, as our understanding of human biology progressed, scientists began to realize that this view of fetal development was wrong. There is no homunculus; that was a mistake. Today we know that Aquinas’s original thought was right - embryos start out as a cluster of cells; human form comes later. But when the biological error was corrected, the church’s moral view did not revert to the older position. Having adopted the theory that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception, the church did not let it go and held fast to the conservative view of abortion. The council of Vienne notwithstanding, it has held that view to this day.
    
    Because the church did not traditionally regard abortion as a serious moral issue, Western law (which developed under the church’s influence) did not traditionally treat abortion as a crime. Under the English common law, abortion was tolerated even if performed late in the pregnancy. In the United States, there were no laws prohibiting it until well into the 19th century. Thus when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the absolute prohibition of abortion to be unconstitutional in 1973, the Court was not overturning a long tradition of moral and legal opinion. It was only restoring a legal situation that had always existed until quite recently.
    
    The purpose of reviewing this history is not to suggest that the contemporary church’s position is wrong. For all that has been said here, its view may be right. I only want to make a point about the relation between religious authority and moral judgment. Church tradition, like Scripture, is reinterpreted by every generation to support its favored moral views. Abortion is just an example of this. We could just as easily have used shifting moral and religious views about slavery, or the status of women, or capital punishment, as our example. In each instance, people’s moral convictions are not so much derived from their religion as superimposed on it.
    
    The various arguments in this chapter point to a common conclusion. Right and wrong are not to be defined in terms of God’s will; morality is a matter of reason and conscience, not religious faith; and in any case, religious considerations do not provide definitive solutions to the specific moral problems that confront us. Morality and religion are, in a word, different. Because this conclusion is contrary to conventional wisdom, it may strike some readers as anti-religious. Therefore, it should be emphasized that this conclusion has not been reached by questioning the validity of religion. The arguments we have considered do not assume that Christianity or any other theological system is false; these arguments merely show that even if such a system is true, morality remains an independent matter.
    
    CULTURE –
    
    Cultural Relativism  holds that the norms of a culture reign supreme within the bounds of the culture itself.
    
    **How is culture defined?**
    
    What if someone told you their culture was the internet? Would that make sense to you? Culture is the beliefs, behaviors, objects, and other characteristics shared by groups of people. Given this, someone could very well say that they are influenced by internet culture, rather than an ethnicity or a society! Culture could be based on shared ethnicity, gender, customs, values, or even objects. Can you think of any cultural objects? Some cultures place significant value in things such as ceremonial artifacts, jewelry, or even clothing. For example, Christmas trees can be considered ceremonial or _cultural objects_. They are representative in both Western religious and commercial holiday culture.
    
    In addition, culture can also demonstrate the way a group thinks, their practices, or behavioral patterns, or their views of the world. For example, in some countries like China, it is acceptable to stare at others in public, or to stand very close to others in public spaces. In South Africa, if you board a nearly empty bus or enter a nearly empty movie theater, it is regarded as polite to sit next to the only person there. On the other hand, in a recent study of Greyhound bus trips in the US, a researcher found that the greatest unspoken rule of bus-taking is that if other seats are available, one should never sit next to another person. Numerous passengers expressed that “it makes you look weird”. These are all examples of cultural norms that people in one society may be used to. Norms that you are used to are neither right nor wrong, just different. Picture walking into a nearly empty movie theater when visiting another country, and not sitting next to the only person in the theater. Another person walks up and tells you off for being rude. You, not used to these norms, feel confused, and anxious. This disorientation you feel is an example of culture shock.

    **What is cultural relativism?**
    
    Have you ever seen or eaten food from another country, such as dried squid or fried crickets and think of it as weird and gross? This is an example of ethnocentrism! That means you use your own culture as the center and evaluate other cultures based on it. You are judging, or making assumptions about the food of other countries based on your own norms, values, or beliefs. Thinking “dried squid is smelly” or “people shouldn’t eat insects” are examples of _ethnocentrism_ in societies where people may not eat dried squid or insects.
    
    Cartoon showing a person offering another man some deep fried crickets. The man who is being offered the crickets says "um, I think I'll pass."
    
    Is ethnocentrism bad or good? On the one hand, ethnocentrism can lead to negative judgments of the behaviors of groups or societies. It can also lead to discrimination against people who are different. For example, in many countries, religious minorities (religions that are not the dominant religion) often face discrimination. But on the other hand, ethnocentrism can create loyalty among the same social group or people in the same society. For example, during the World Cup or Olympics, you may tend to root for your own country and believe that the players or teams representing your country are much better. National pride is also part of ethnocentrism.
    
    To avoid judging the cultural practices of groups that are different to yours, we can use the _cultural relativism_ approach. Cultural relativism refers to not judging a culture to our own standards of what is right or wrong, strange or normal. Instead, we should try to understand cultural practices of other groups in its own cultural context. For example, instead of thinking, “Fried crickets are disgusting! ” one should instead ask, “Why do some cultures eat fried insects?”. You may learn that fried crickets or grasshoppers are full of protein and in Mexico, it is famous Oaxaca regional cuisine and have been eaten for thousands of years as a healthy food source!

    Some people worry that the concept of culture can also be abused and misinterpreted. If one culture behaves one way, does that mean all cultures can behave that way as well? For example, many countries and international organizations oppose the act of whaling (the fishing of whales) for environmental reasons. These environmental organizations say that there are not many whales left and such fishing practices should be stopped. However, other countries argue that whaling is a cultural practice that has been around for thousands of years. Because it may be part of a country’s oceanic culture, this country may say that such a cultural practice should not be opposed based on cultural differences, say, by an inland country that does not understand. Who gets to define what a moral cultural behavior is? Is whaling immoral? Two different cultures may have very different answers, as we saw in the above example. Another more extreme instance would be female genital cutting in some parts of the world. Locally, it is argued that the practice has cultural roots, but such a practice has raised concerns among many international human rights organizations.
    
    Anthropologists say that when we think about different cultures and societies, we should think about their customs in a way that helps us make sense of how their cultural practices fits with their overall cultural context. For example, having several wives perhaps makes economic sense among herders who move around frequently. Through such an understanding, polygamy makes cultural sense.
