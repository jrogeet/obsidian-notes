# Model for Ethical Decision Making

1. **GATHER THE FACTS** - Frequently ethical dilemmas can be resolved simply by clarifying the facts of the case in question. In those cases that prove to be more difficult, gathering the facts is the essential first step prior to any ethical analysis and reflection on the case. In analyzing a case, we want to know the available facts  at hand as well as any facts currently not known but that need to be ascertained.  Thus one is asking not only “What do we know?” but also “ What do we need to know?” in order to make an intelligent ethical decision.

2. DETERMINE THE ETHICAL ISSUES

The ethical issues are stated in terms of competing interests or goods. It’s these conflicting interests that actually make for an ethical dilemma. The issues should be presented ia a ______versus _________ format in order to reflect the interests that are colliding in a particular ethical dilemma. For example, in business ethics there is often a conflict between the right of a firm to make profit and its obligation to the community. In this case, the obligation pertains to the environment

3. WHAT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES HAVE A BEARING ON THE CASE

-   In any ethical dilemma, there are certain moral values or principles that are central to the conflicting positions being taken. It is critical to identify these principles, and in some cases, to determine whether some principles are to be weighted more heavily than others. Clearly, biblical principles will be weighted the most heavily. There may be other principles that speak to the case that come from other sources.  There may be constitutional principles or principles drawn from natural law that supplement the biblical principles that come into play here.  The principles that come out of your mission and calling are also important to consider.

4.  LIST THE ALTERNATIVES

-   -   Part of the creative thinking involved in resolving an ethical dilemma involves coming up with various alternative courses of action. Although there will be some alternatives that you will rule out without much thought, in general the more alternatives that are listed, the better the chance that your list will include some high-quality ones. In addition, you may come up with some very creative alternative that you had not considered before.

5. COMPARE THE ALTERNATIVES WITH THE PRINCIPLES

At this point, the task is one of eliminating alternatives according to the moral principles that have a bearing on the case. In many instances, the case will be resolved at this point, since the principles will eliminate all alternatives except one. In fact, the purpose of this comparison is to see if there is a clear decision that can be made without further deliberations.  If a clear decision is not forthcoming, then the next part is the model that must be considered. At the least, some of the alternatives may be eliminated by this step of comparison.

6, WEIGH THE CONSEQUENCES

  If the principles do not yield a clear decision, then a consideration of the consequences of the remaining available alternatives is in order.  Both positive and negative consequences are to be considered. They should be informally weighed, since some positive consequences are more detrimental than others.

7. MAKE A DECISION

-   Deliberations cannot go on forever. At some point, a decision must be made. Realize that one common element in ethical dilemmas is that there are no easy and painless solutions to them.  Frequently the decision that is made is one that involves the least number of problems or negative consequences, not one that is devoid of them.

# Lawrence Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development

**Lawrence** **Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development.**

In recent years, psychologist looked at many of the same question asked by philosophers have pondered but from their own professional perspective. Psychologist’s theories of moral development provide an insight into how moral disagreement developed and even how they untangle it.

Lawrence Kohlberg, a professor of psychology in Harvard University is a prominent moral development theorist, but his thinking grew out of Jean Piaget’s writing on children’s intellectual development. His theory is descriptive, rather than, proven facts.

Kohlberg presumes that there are six stages of moral development that people go through in much the same way as infants learned first to role over, to sit, to crawl, to stand and finally to walk. Kohlberg clearly emphasized the following system of his theory:

1.  Everyone goes through each stage in the same order, but not everyone goes through all the stages and
2.  A person at one stage can understand the reasoning of any stage below him but cannot understand more than one stage above.

These correlates, especially the latter one, are important when it comes to assessing the nature of disagreement about ethical judgment. Perhaps the easiest way is to remember them is by differing kinds of justification involved in each stage. There are three levels in his theory and each level is divided into stages. The schema will show the stages of moral development:

1.  **Pre-conventional level**

_(pre-conventional because individuals do not yet speak as members of society, instead they see morality as something external to themselves)_

**Stage**

**Description**

**Content**

**Social Perspective**

**Stage 1**

**Punishment**

**and**

**Obedience**

The first stage is characterized by a view that right action is to behave according to social acceptable norms imposed by some authority figure (e.g., parent, teacher) in order to avoid punishment.

Right is a literal obedience to rules and authority, avoiding punishment, and not doing physical harm. What is right is to avoid breaking rules, to obey for obedience’s sake and to avoid physical damage to people and authority. Thus follow and obey because of the consequence of punishment and due to superior power of authorities.

This stage takes an egocentric point of view, a person at this stage does not consider the interests of others and does not relate two points of view. Actions were justified in terms of physical consequence rather in terms psychological interests of others. Authority’s perspective is confused with one’s own.

**Stage 2**

**Individual**

**And instrumental exchange**

Is characterized by a view that right behavior means acting in one’s own best interests.

What is right is following rules when it is to someone’s immediate interest. Right is acting to meet one’s interests and needs and letting others do the same. Right  is also what is fair, that is, what is an equal exchange, a deal, am agreement. The reason for doing what is right is to serve one’s own needs/interests in a world where one must recognize that other people have their interests as well.

This stage takes a concrete  individualistic perspective. A person at this stage separates his own interests and points of view from those of authorities and others.  The person integrates or relates conflicting individual interests to one another through instrumental exchange of service, need for others and other’s goodwill. Perhaps through fairness giving each person the same amount.

1.  **Conventional Level**

_(it speaks on isolated individuals rather than as members of the society. It sees individual exchanging favors, but there is still no identification with the values of the family/community)_

**Stage 3**

**Mutual**

**and**

**interpersonal**

**conformity**

Characterized by an attitude which one seeks to do that will gain the approval of others.

It sees what is right is living up according to the expectations by people that are close to them, like the family, community. Being good and having good behavior means having good motives and interpersonal feelings such as empathy, love, trust, concern.

This stage takes the perspective of the individual in relationship to other individuals. Thus, a person in this stage is aware of the shared feelings, agreement and expectations that take primacy over the individual interests.

**Stage 4**

**Law**

**And**

**Order**

Is characterized by abiding the law and respecting authority and performing one’s duty so that social order is maintained.

What is right is fulfilling one’s own duty to which one had agreed. The reasons for doing what is right are to keep the institutions going as a whole.

This stage differentiates societal point of view from interpersonal agreement or motives. A person at this stage takes the viewpoint of the system, which defines roles and rules, individual relations in terms of one’s own place in the system.

1.  **Post-conventional level**

_(moral decisions are generated from the rights, values or principles that are or that could be agreeable to all individuals composing or creating a society designed to have fair and beneficial practices)_

**Stage 5**

**Social contract**

**And**

**Individual rights**

Is characterized by thinking about a society in a very theoretical way, stepping back from their own established society and considering the rights and values of the society ought to uphold.

What is right is the awareness of the fact that people hold a variety of values and opinion that most values and rules are relative to one’s group. The reason for doing what is right, is in general, feeling obligated to obey the law, because one has made a social contract to make and abide by laws for the good of all and to protect their own rights and the rights of others. Like, family, friend. One is concerned that laws and duties be based from a rational calculation of the overall ‘utility’. ‘The greatest good for the greatest number’

This stage takes a ‘prior-to-society’ perspective. It means that individuals are aware of the values and rights prior to social attachment and contract. The person integrates perspective by formal mechanism of agreement, contract, objective impartiality and due process.

**Stage 6**

**Universal ethical**

**principles**

Is characterized by an attitude of respect for universal principle and the demands of individual conscience.

The right action on this stage is guided by universal ethical principles, particularly law, social agreement are usually valid because it is anchored to principles. When law perhaps violates the universal principle one is often acts in accordance with the principle. The principle of equality, justice, respect and others. These are not only values but regarded as principle that is of used in order to generate decisions.

This stage takes the perspective that a person takes a stand in view of moral principle from which social agreement are derived on which they are grounded.
