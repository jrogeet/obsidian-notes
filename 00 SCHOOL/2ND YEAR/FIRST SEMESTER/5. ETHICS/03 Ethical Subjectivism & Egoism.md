# Ethical Subjectivism
2 Types of Subjectivism:
- Normative Subjectivism
- Meta-Ethical Subjectivism
***
### Normative Subjectivism
- According to normative subjectivism, **an act is morally right if, and only if, the person judging the action approves it**.
- Normative subjectivism allows that moral judgements can be true or false. There is truth in ethics, but no objective truth. A moral judgment is true just in case it accurately reports the sentiments of the speaker.
- Sincerity is the mark of ethical truth. If normative subjectivism is true, then one's sincere moral judgmets cannot be mistaken.

- When someone utters the phrase "Murder is wrong," what they say is true if, and only if, they actually disapprove of murder.

> In this case, if both speakers are honestly expressing their beliefs, then what each person

- On normative subjectivism. some moral judgments can be false. A moral judgment would be false if the speaker who utters it is not honestly reporting his or her beliefs. For example, if one lies about what they approve or disapprove of, then they're statement would be false.
> For example, if a man lies about his ethical views because he thinks that's what his audience wants to hear, then what he has said is false.
#### An Argument for NORMATIVE SUBJECTIVISM
- The argument from disagreement:
1. There is persistent disagreement about moral matters. disagreement that cannot be rationally resolved.
2. The best explanation for such persistent, unresolvable disagreement is that there is no objective truth about moral matters.
3. Moral judgments can nevertheless be true or false
4. Therefore, the truth or falsity of moral judgments is not objective, but depends on the attitudes of those making the judgments.

#### Objections to the Argument
- Most of the objections to this argument are going to focus  on premise 2: the best explanation premise.
- One might think that the best eplanation of moral disagreement is that we haven't enough information to settle the issue yet.
> There was a time when people disagreed about the shape of the Earth, whether the Earth rotated around the sun or vice versa, and many other issues. Ethics, the objection goes, may be just like these disagreements.

## Meta-ethical Subjectivism
- Meta-ethical subjectivism is not a normative view; it makes a claim about normative views.
- Meta-ethical subjectivism claims that normative ethical theories, and moral judgments in general, cannot be true.
> Note: meta-ethical subjectivism implies the falsity of normative subjectivism, and vice versa.

<br>
- According to meta-ethical subjectivism, the purpose of moral judgment is not to report personal or social attitudes, but rather to express one's feelings or voice one's commitments.
- For instance, when one says, "infanticide is wrong," even though this looks like a statement that could be true or false, it is in fact just an expression of dislike or dissatisfacetion with infanticide. It would be like saying "Boo infanticide" or "I don't linke infanticide."
> These things can't be true or false becuase emotive expressions and likes/dislikes can't be true or flase.

#### An Argument for Meta-Ethical Subjectivism
- The argument from moral motivation:
1. Every moral judgment motivates all by itself.
2. Factual judgments cannot motivate all by themselves.
3. Therefore moral judgments are not factual judgments.
- Premise 1 claims that moral judgments are motivational. This means that to judge and action right is to be motivated to perform it. Similarly, to judge a action wrong, is to be motivated to not perform it.
> If one judges that eating animas is wrong, then such a person must be motivated to not eat animals.

- Premise 2 claims that factual judgments cannot motivate by themselves. This means that beliefs, in and of themselves, cannot move us to act. In order to act, we must be motivated by a desire of some sort.
> For EXAMPLE, we believe all sorts of mathematical, chemical, and physical propositions without be moved at all. And when we are moved by factual judgments it seems to be because there is also some accompanying desire.

#### Objections to the Argument
- Shafer-Landau notes that premise 2 is widely accepted as true, so most of the attack o nthis argument will be on premise 1.
- It's open to objectors to claim that moral judgments are factual claims-- claims that express beliefs-- and so could be true or false AND not be able to motivate.

# Ethical Egoism
- The idea that each person ought to pursue his/her own self-interest exclusively
- It differs from Psychological Egoism which is a theory of human nature concerned with how people do behave
- Ethical Egoism by contrast is a normative theory (a theory about how we ought to behave)
- It argues we have no duty except to do what is best for ourselves
- There is only one ultimate principle of conduct - the principle of self-interest
- All duties and obligations are subject to self-interest
##### Important
- Ethical Egoism does not say that you should avoid actions that help others
- It could be that by helping others you help yourself
- 'You scratch my back and i'll scratch yours'
- Or your interests coincide with interests of others and by helping yourself you inadvertently help others
- The important point is that in such cases the benefit to others is not what makes the action right
#### Selfishness not foolishness
- It is also important to realise it doesn't endorse the idea that we ought alsways to do what we want to
- Short term pleasures may be harmful in the long run
- It doesn't lead to a debauched hedonistic lifestyle
- It says that a person really ought to do what really is in his/her own best advantage over the long run - **It endorses selfishness not foolishness**
### Two arguments in support of Ethical Egoism
A. Each of us is intimately familiar with out own individual needs and wants but we cannot know the desires and need of other people
B. The policy of looking out for others is an offensive intrusion into other people's privacy
C. Making other people the object of one's 'charity' is degrading to them it robs them of their dignity and self-respect

## Value of the human individual
- Rand is arguing along these lines
- A person has only one life to live. If we value the individual - that is, if the individual has moral worth - then we must agree that this life is of supreme importance
- If your willing to sacrifice for the good of others (altruism) you are not truly valuing the human individual
- Therefore Ethical Egoism is the philosophy that ought to be accepted

### James Rachels - Two arguments against Ethical Egoism
1. Rachels argues that... Ethical Egoism cannot provide solutions for conflicts of interest
- We need moral rules because our interests some times come into conflict
2. Ethical Egoism advocates that each of us divides the world into two categories of people - ourselves and the rest - and we regard the interests of the first group as more important than the interests of the second group.
- But what is the difference between myself and other that justifies placing myself in this special category
- Am i more intelligent?
- Do i enjoy my life more?
- Are my achievements greater?
- What makes me so special?
- Failing an answer Ethical Egoism is an arbitrary doctrine
