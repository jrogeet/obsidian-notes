# What is ETHICS?
- Ethics was taken from the Greek word `ethos` which means `customs`, `usage` `characteristic`, thus, the term ethics is expressed in various ways of understanding and examining the moral life of the person as it is cited **by Beauchamp and Childress (1994).**
- It is a branch of philosophy that is a philosophical enterprise that investigates and questions the way or the nature of human actions, see if it has a ground so that is supports its own moral claim.
- Ethics investigates or studies morality.

The ethical dimension of Human Existence
Ethics as a subject for us to study is about determining the gorunds for the values w/ particular and special significance to **HUMAN LIFE.**

**Aesthetic** means Art and Beauty
**Etiquette** is not *Ethics*

- It shows us that aesthetic considerations and questions of ETIQUETTE are important facets of human life. *But they do not necessarily translate into genuine ethical or moral value.*
- **THE CHOISE OF CLOTHING THAT ONE IS TO WEAR,** in general, seems to be *merely a question of aesthetics*, and thus one is taste.
- Yet in some cultures, what a woman wears (or does not wear) may bring upon harsh punishment to her according to the community's rule.
- Afghanistan in the 1990s was ruled by Taliba, and women were expected to wear the full-body burga; a woman caught in public with even a small area of her body exposed could be flogged serverely.

TECHNICAL VALUATIONS

- In normative approach it includes general normative ethics and applied ethics. The former emphasizes any philosophical attempt to formulate and to defend basic moral principles and virtues governing the moral life, thus, it emphasizes ETHICAL THEORIES like natural law theory, utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics etc. 
- The PRINCIPLES found in normative general ethics that are regarded to be of help to guide an action and are commonly applied to some specific moral problems such as in medicine, nursing and other medical sciences; thus, it yields an APPLIED ETHICS

##### NON-NORMATIVE ETHICS
- This approach is a non-evaluative one. IT SIMPLY CONSIDERS BY KNOWING WHAT IT IS AND DESCRIBES CERTAIN ACITONS
