**Data Structure** - for storing a collection of items; An Abstract Data Type(ADT) that is frequently used in most programming languages is a stack. It is called a `stack` because it functions like a stack in the real world, such as `a deck of cards, a pile of plates`, etc.

Linked List - `In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.` **Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of modes which together represent a sequence.**

a) each boxes can represented as an Object

In which each node is connected to the next one on the sequence `nodes are also called objects`

Bubble sort may be defined as the sorting algorithm that follows the approach of replacing the value in the first index with the smallest value in the array and keep it repeating until the list is  sorted. It is a very simple way of performing sorting. In this way to sort the array, the value has to be assigned to the array in the beginning before starting the sorting. 

The first smallest value found in the array and been moved to the first index of the array and then the search begins again to find the other smallest number. Once
