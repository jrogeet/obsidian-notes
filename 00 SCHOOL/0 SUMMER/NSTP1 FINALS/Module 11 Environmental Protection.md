___Environmental Protection___ is a practice of protection the environment, on individual, organizational or governmental level, for the benefit of the natural environment and (or) humans. Due to the pressures of population and our technology the Biophysical Environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized and governments began placing restraints on activities that caused Environmental Degradation. Since the 1960s activism by the environmental movement ha created awareness of the various environmental issues. There is not a full agreement on the extent of the various environmental impacts of human activity and protection measures are occasionally criticized.

## Kinds of Pollution

### Air pollution
- To be a pollutant, a material has to be potentially harmful to life. A layer above the Earth’s surface supports life it is known as troposphere. Air pollution has existed since first used fire. Almost all air pollutants is the result of burning fossil fuel, either in your home, by industry in internal combustion engine. Some serious consequences are:
- Acid Rain
- Ozone Layer Depletion
- Photochemical Smog
- Greenhouse Effect

### Land Pollution
- Littering is one of the main effects of land pollution today. Land pollution is also soil pollution of which has deposits of solid waste, non-biodegradable materials, and poisons. Land pollution has a mass globally, everyday threatening the very foundation and mechanical support of every matter on Earth. Statistically, it has been shown that:
- There is a loss of 6 million hectares of land per year.
- There is a loss of 24 billion tons of topsoil per year.

### Water Pollution
- There is no such thing as naturally pure water. As water flows into ground and filters through layers of soil and rock in the ground, it dissolve and absorbs the substances that it touches, some of these substances are harmless. These some substances are man-made chemicals, and are considered contaminants that can make water unsafe. Some contaminants come from erosion of natural rock formation. Others come from factories, applied to farm lands, or used by consumers. Reports tell which contaminants are in your drinking water, and at which level they were found.

- Promote National Research and Development Programs for improved solid waste management and resource conservation techniques, more effective institutional arrangement and indigenous and improved methods of waste reduction, collection, separation and recovery;
- Encourage greater private sector participation is solid waste management;
- Retain primary enforcement and responsibility of solid waste management with local government units while establishing a cooperative effort among the National Government, other local government units, non-government organizations, and the private sector;
- Encourage cooperation and self-regulation among waste generators through the application of market-based instruments;
- Institutionalize public participation in the development and implementation, comprehensive and ecological waste management programs; and of national and local integrated
- Strengthen the integration of ecological solid waste management and resource conservation and recovery topics in the academic curricula of formal and non-formal education in order to promote environmental awareness and action among the citizenry.

##   Types of waste identified by RA 9003
### Solid Waste
- A ___solid waste___ does not flow like water or gas. 
- Examples include paper, wood, metals, and glass, plastic and contaminated soil. 
- Solid waste can be hazardous or non-hazardous. 
- Problems associated with non-hazardous solid waste include aesthetic problems (litter and odors), leachate from the infiltration of water through the waste, and off gases resulting from biodegradation. Nonhazardous solid wastes are commonly handled by recycling, combustion, land filling, and composting.

### Liquid Waste
- ___Liquid wastes___ must be transported in containers or through pipes. 
- Examples include sewage, contaminated ground water, and industrial liquid discharges. In some cases, direct discharge to the environment may be allowed. 
- However, depending on the waste’s characteristics, direct discharge may cause unacceptable environmental harm. 
- For example, large amounts of sewage discharged into a stream can result in fish kills. Liquid wastes containing excreta can contain pathogenic organisms.
- Other liquid wastes may be toxic. Liquid wastes are often handled at wastewater treatment plants, followed by discharge to the environment.

### Gaseous wastes
- ___Gaseous wastes___, of course, consists of gases. 
- They are primarily generated by combustion (e.g. internal combustion engines, incinerators, coal-fired electrical generating plants) and industrial processes. 
- Depending on their characteristics, gaseous wastes can be odiferous or toxic. 
- Some are implicated in global warming, ozone depletion, and smog. 
- Gaseous wastes may be released to the atmosphere or captured/treated with pollution control equipment.

### Hazardous Wastes
- ___Hazardous wastes___ pose a substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment. 
- They can be solid, sludge, liquid, or gas. 
- Hazardous wastes have at least one of the following characteristics: corrosivity, ignitability, reactivity, and toxicity. 
- Hazardous chemical-physical-biological treatment, and land filling.

### Radioactive Wastes
- ___Radioactive wastes___ emit particles or electromagnetic radiation (e.g. alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and x-rays). 
- Radioactive wastes can be high level, transuranic, or low level. High level radioactive wastes are from spent or reprocessed nuclear reactor fuel. 
- Transuranic wastes are from isotopes above uranium in the periodic table. 
- They are generally low in radio activity, but have long half-lives. Low-level wastes have little radioactivity and can often be handled with little or no shielding. 
- Radiation can damage living cells and cause cancer. 
- Although recycling and incineration may reduce waste amounts, the primary method for handling radioactive wastes is long-term storage.

### Medical wastes
- ___Medical wastes___, that is, wastes generated at medical facilities, can be infectious, toxic, and/or radioactive. 
- Though they may have hazardous characteristics, they are not regulated as hazardous wastes. 
- Some medical wastes are sterilized, disinfected, or incinerated, especially infectious wastes. 
- Recycling and land filling are also used to dispose them.



## Ways to Prevent Air Pollution
- The fact that human activities contribute the most to air pollution, considering the harmful effects of air pollution, now it is very essential that everyone should contribute a bit to prevent air pollution. There are certain ways that one can help to reduce the emission of air pollutants in the atmosphere. Following are some tips for preventing air pollution:

### Car Pool
- forming and implementing a car pool will reduce the number of cars, thereby, preventing air pollution by cutting down the use of fossil fuels. This way, it will help in the sustainable use of fossil fuel and its conservation for the future generations.

### Vehicle Care
- Timely servicing of the car helps to keep it in a good condition and also minimizes fuel exhaust. Driving the car at an average speed and turning off in traffic is a key to save fuel. Make sure to use unleaded petrol and opt for regular pollution checking of your car.

### Public Transport
- Whenever possible, try to travel by public transports. This helps in two ways; prevents air pollution and increases public income. If you are going to a nearby place, go by walking or use bicycle, instead of using your vehicle. The objective is to minimize the use of fuels, as far as possible.

### Alternative Energy Source
- Another effective way to prevent air pollution is to use alternative energy sources such as solar energy, hydroelectric energy and wind energy. Nowadays, sophisticated technologies such as wind turbine, solar water heaters are introduced to generate electricity and other energy forms for the household use.

### Saving Energy
- Saving energy will, of course, help to prevent air pollution. Switch off the lights, fans, air conditioners, televisions, and other appliances, when not in use. You can also share a room with others when the air conditioner or fan is on, instead of switching them on in every room.

### Minimize Air Pollutants
- Always try to minimize smoke emission, as it can contribute to air pollution. One way is to compost dried leaves and kitchen wastes, instead of burning them. Composting will also give you organic fertilizer for your garden. While buying the products, always choose air-friendly and recyclable products that will minimize the emission of pollutants.
