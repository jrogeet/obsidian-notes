# Disaster Preparedness
- Preparing for a disaster can reduce the fear, anxiety and losses that disasters cause. A disaster can be a natural disaster, like hurricane, tornado, flood or earthquake. It might also be man-made, like a bioterrorist attack or chemical spill. You should know the risks and danger signs of different types of disasters. You should also have a disaster plan. Be ready to evacuate your home, and know how to treat basic medical problems. Make sure you have the insurance you need, including special types, like flood insurance.
- No matter what kind of disaster you experience, it causes emotional distress. After a disaster, recovery can take any time. Stay connected to your family and friends during this period.

- Process of ensuring that an organization (1) has complied with the preventive measures, (2) is in a state of readiness to contain the effects of a forecasted disastrous event to minimize loss of life, injury, and damage to property, (3) can provide rescue, relief, rehabilitation, and other services in the aftermath of the disaster, and (4) has the capacity and resources to continue to sustain its essential functions without being overwhelmed by the demand placed on them. Preparedness for the first and immediate response is called Emergency Preparedness.
### What to do Before an Earthquake
- Make sure you have a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries at home.
- Learn first aid.
- Learn how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity.
- Make up a plan of where to meet your family after an earthquake.
- Don’t leave heavy objects on shelves (they’ll fall during earth quake).
- Anchor heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor.
- Learn the earthquake plan at your school or workplace.
### What to do DURING an Earthquake
- Stay calm! If you’re indoor, stay inside. If you’re outside, stay outside.
- In you’re indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from the windows and outside doors.
- If you’re outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you).
- Don’t use matches, candles, or any flame. Broken gas lines and fire don’t mix.
- If you’re in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.
- Don’t use elevators (they’ll probably get stuck anyway).
### What to do AFTER an Earthquake
- Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for anyone who needs it.
- Turn on the radio. Don’t use the phone unless it’s an emergency.
- Be careful around broken glass and debris. Wear boots or sturdy shoes to keep from cutting your feet.
- Check water, gas, and electric lines for damage. If any are damaged, shut off the valves. Check for the smell of gas. If you smell it, open all the windows and doors, leave immediately, and report it to the authorities (use someone else’s phone).
- Stay out of damaged buildings.
- Be careful of chimneys (they may fall on you).
- Stay away from beaches. Tsunamis and seiches sometimes hit after the ground has stopped shaking.
- Stay away from damaged areas.
- If you’re at school or work, follow the emergency plan or the instructions of the person in charge.
- Expect aftershocks.

## Fire Prevention
### Fire Safety Tips

- Of course, the best way to practice fire safety is to make sure a fire doesn’t break out in the first place. That means you should always be aware of potential hazards in your home, start by keeping these tips in mind.
- Check all electrical appliances, cords, and outlets
- Look around your house for potential problems. And unless you’re a trained electrician, be careful about do-it-yourself electrical projects. Studies have shown that many home fires are caused by improper installation of electrical devices.

#### Be especially vigilant about portable heaters

- The number of residential fires always goes up during colder month, peaking between December and February. Portable space heaters substantially contribute to this increase. Before plugging in your space heater, make  sure you know how to use it safely.

#### Be careful in the kitchen
- Did you know that cooking is the leading cause of home fires in the United States? The kitchen is rife with ways for a fire to start: food left unsupervised on a stove or in an oven or microwave; grease spills; a dish towel too close to the burner; a toaster or toaster oven flare-up; a coffee pot accidentally left-on.
- Always supervise kids while cooking and practice safe cooking habits – like turning all pot handles in so they can’t be accidentally knocked over and not wearing loose-fitting clothing that could catch fire around the stove.
#### Check the fireplace
- Fireplaces should be kept clean and covered with a screen to keep sparks from jumping out. Only wood should be burned in the fireplace – paper and other materials can escape while burning and ignite nearby items. Never leave a fire burning unattended and make sure a fire is completely extinguisher before leaving the house or going to bed. Have the chimney professionally cleaned once a year.

#### Beware of Cigarettes
- According to the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA), Cigarettes are the no. 1 cause of fire deaths in the United States and Canada, killing about 1,000 per year. Most are started when the ashes or butts fall into couches and chairs. If you smoke, be especially careful around upholstered furniture, never smoke in bed, and be sure cigarettes are completely out before you toss them in the trash.

#### Keep fire extinguishers handy
- Be prepared for any accidents by having fire extinguishers strategically placed around your house – at least one on each floor and in kitchen (this one should be an all-purpose extinguisher, meaning it can be used on grease and electrical fires), the basement, the garage, or workshop area. Keep them out of reach of children.

#### Practice Fire Drills at Home
- Kids have fire drills at school and adults have them at work. Why shouldn’t  you have them at home, too? Fires are frightening and can cause panic. By rehearsing different scenarios, your family will be less likely to waste precious time trying to figure out what to do. Discuss and rehearse the escape routes you’ve planned for each room of your home. Designate a meeting place outside your house or apartment building that is a safe distance away (a mailbox, a fence, or even a distinctive-looking tree will do) where everyone can be accounted for after they escape.
#### Plan a head
- Determine whether you can remain in your home during the typhoon. You may be able to ride out a weak typhoon with a small storm surge but will need to evacuate for stronger storms. Listen for warnings from your local officials or weather personnel in situations where evacuation is ordered. Note the evacuation routes and plan to leave early.
- Make lists of television and radio stations where you can get storm information, phone numbers to call in case of emergencies and locations of storm shelters. Get directions for the emergency shelters.

## Preparing for a TYPHOON
Designate a location for you and your family members to meet if you get separated and the number of an out-of-state relative to call to say everyone is safe. That out-of-state person starts the phone tree to others on your list after learning you are okay.

Find a place to take your pets where they will be safe if you have to evacuate. Most storm shelters won’t allow pets.

Remember to shut off electricity, water and gas to your home before evacuating.

#### Assemble a Typhoon Kit
- Pack food that doesn’t have to be refrigerated or cooked along with disposable plates, bowls, forks, knives and spoons. Each person and pet in the home should have enough to eat for three days.
- Store water. Each person needs three gallons of clean water to drink and to use for washing. Pets also need water.
- Include a first aid kit in your typhoon kit.
- Remember to pack board games, card decks and a battery-operated radio.
- Throw in a box of garbage bags and paper towels.


- Pack your Bags

- Pack a small bag or backpack for each person in the home. It should include clothes and toiletries for three days.

- Bundle a blanket and pillow for each person and place them in garbage bags (to keep them dry) to take along if evacuating.

- Include a small bag of photos and documents you can’t afford to have destroyed, such as wills and wedding albums.

- Place everyone’s bag and bed bundle near the door so they can be quickly loaded into the car if you decide to evacuate. Fill the car with gas.

### AFTER TYPHOON
Avoid going out for a picnic or excursion immediately after a typhoon. It is usually calm after a typhoon. Wait until the typhoon has totally left the place.

Listen to radio announcements to know about the typhoon and the weather.

- Check the roofs or construction of your house. Is your roof was damaged? Check and fix it.
- Is there any injured or is their any neighbors injured during the typhoon? Bring them to the nearest disaster coordinating council hospital or medical centers?

## Plan for TSUNAMI
- ___Develop a Family Disaster Plan___. Please see the “Family Disaster Plan” section for general family panning information.
- ___Learn about Tsunami risk in your community___. Contact your local emergency management office or American Red Cross Chapter. Find out if your home, school, workplace or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard areas. Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other high-risk waters. Evacuation orders may be based on these numbers.
- ___If you are visiting an area at risk for Tsunami___, check with the hotel, motel, or camp ground operators for tsunami evacuation information and how you would be warned. It is important to now designated escape routes before a warning is issued. If you are at risk from tsunamis, do the following:
- ___Plan an evacuation route___ from your home, school, workplace, or any other place you’ll be where Tsunamis present a risk. If possible, pick an area 100 feet above sea level or go up to two miles inland, away from the coastline. If you can’t get this high or far, go as high as you can. Every foot inland or upwards makes a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes. After a disaster, roads may become impassable or blocked. Be prepared to evacuate by foot if necessary. Foot paths normally lead uphill and inland, while many roads parallel coastlines. Follow posted Tsunami evacuations routes; these will lead to safety. Local emergency management officials can help advise you as to the best route safety and likely shelter locations.
- ___Practice your evacuation route___. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency situation.
- ___Use a NOAA Weather Radio with tone-alert feature___ to keep you informed of local watches and warnings. The tone alert feature will warn you of potential danger even if you are not currently listening to local radio or television stations.
- ___Talk to your insurance agent___. Homeowners’ policies do not cover flooding from a Tsunami. Ask about the National Flood Insurance Program.
- ___Discuss Tsunami with your family___. Everyone should know what to do in case all famly members are not together. Discussing Tsunamis ahead of time will help reduce fear and anxiety, and let everyone know how to respond. Review flood safety and preparedness measures with your family.
- ___Assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit___. Please see the section “Disaster Supplies Kit” for general Supplies Kit information. Tsunami-specific supplies should include the following:
- Evacuation Supplies Kit in an easy-to-carry container (backpack) near your door.
- Disaster Supplies Kit Basics.
