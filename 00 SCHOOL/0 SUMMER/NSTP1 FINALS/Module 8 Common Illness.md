___Infection___ is the invasion of the body by harmful organisms such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rickets or viruses.

___Carrier___ is any person who harbors the organism and is capable of transmitting it to another individual showing no signs or manifestation of the disease.

___Communicable disease___ is an illness cause by an infectious agent that is transmitted directly or indirectly to a well person through an agency and a vector or an inanimate object.

___Contact___ is any person or animal that is in closely association with an infected person, animal, or freshly soiled materials.

___Contagious disease___ is a disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another directly or indirectly.

___Disinfection___ is the process of eliminating infective microorganisms from the contaminated instruments, clothing, or surroundings by physical means or chemical.

___Host___ is an animal or plant or which a parasite leaves.

___Infectious disease___ is transmitted not only by ordinary contact but requires direct contact of the organism through an opening in the skin.

## General Infection Control Measure
1. Apply good basic hygiene practices with regular hand washing.
2. Cover existing wounds or skin lesions with waterproof dressings
3. Avoid invasive procedures if suffering from chronic skin lesions on hands

- Avoid contamination of person by appropriate use of protective clothing.
- Protect mucous membrane of eyes mouth and nose from blood splashes
- Prevent puncture wounds, cuts and abrasions in the presence of blood

_AVOID_: Avoid sharps usage where possible
_INSTITUTE:_ Institute safe procedures for handling and disposal of needles and other sharps
_INSTITUTE_: Institute approved procedures for sterilization and disinfect surfaces

## Hand Hygiene
- ___Hand Hygiene___ refers to removing or killing microorganisms (germs) on the hands. When performed correctly, hand hygiene is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and infections. In health care, hand hygiene is used to eliminate transient microorganisms that have been picked up via contact with patients, contaminated equipment or the environment. Hand hygiene may be performed either by using soap and running water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs.

### When should Hand Hygiene be performed?
- In health care, hand hygiene is required:
- _Before_ and _after_ contact with any __patient/resident__, their body substances or items contaminated by them
- _Between_ different procedures on the same patient/ resident
- _Before_ and _after_ performing __invasive__ procedures
- _Before_ preparing, handling, serving or eating food or feeding a patient/resident
- _After_ assisting patients/residents with personal care (e.g. assisting patient to blow nose, toileting or doing wound care)
- _Before_ putting on and after taking off gloves
- _After_ performing personal functions (e.g. using the toilet, blowing your nose)
- When hands come into contact with secretions, excretions, blood and body fluids (use soap and running water whenever hands are visibly soiled)

## Standard Precautions
- Assume that every person is potentially infected or colonized with an organism that could be transmitted in the healthcare setting and apply the following control practices during the delivery of health care.

### Hand Hygiene
- During the delivery of healthcare, avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces in close proximity to the patient both contamination of clean hands from environmental surfaces and transmission of pathogens from contaminated hands surfaces.
- When hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, or visibly soiled with blood or body fluids, wash hands with either a non-antimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water.
### Gowns
- Wear a gown, that is appropriate to the task, to protect the skin and prevent soiling or contamination of clothing during procedures and patient-care activities when contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions is anticipated.
- Wear gown for direct patient contact if the patient has uncontained secretions or excretions.
- Remove gown and perform hand hygiene before leaving the patient’s environment.
### Mouth, Nose, Eye PROTECTION
- Use PPE to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient-care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions. Select masks, goggles, face shields, and combinations of each according to the need anticipated by the task performed.

## Contact Precautions
- In addition to Standard Procedures, use Contact Precautions, or equivalent, for specified patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important microorganism that can be transmitted by direct contact with the patient (hand or skin-to-skin contact that occurs when performing patient-care activities that require touching the patient’s dry skin) or indirect contact with environmental surfaces or patient-care items in the patient’s environment.
### Patient Placement
- Place the patient in a private room. When the private room is not available, place the patient in a room with a patient who has active infection with the same microorganism but with no other infection. When a private room is not available and chorting is not achievable, consider the epidemiology of the microorganisms and the patient population when determining patient placement. Consultation with infection control professionals is advised before patient placement.
### Gloves and Hand Washing
- In addition to wearing a gown as outlined under Standard Precautions, wear gloves (a clean, non-sterile gown is adequate) when entering the room. During the course of proving care for the patient, change gloves after having contact with infective material that may contain high concentrations of microorganisms (fecal material and wound drainage). Remove gloves before leaving the patients room and wash hands immediately with an anti microbial agent or a waterless antiseptic agent. After glove removal and hand washing, ensure that hands do not touch potentially contaminated surfaces or items in the patient’s room to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments.
### Gown
- In addition to wearing a gown as outlined under Standard Precautions, wear a gown ( a clean, non-sterile gown is adequate) when entering the room if you anticipate that your clothing will be substantial contact with the patient, environmental surfaces, or if the patient is incontinent or has diarrhea, an ileostomy, a colostomy, or wound drainage not contained by dressing. Remove the gown before leaving the patient’s environment. After gown removal, ensure that clothing does not contact potentially contaminated environmental surfaces to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments.
### Patient Transport
- Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room essential purposes only. If the patient is transported out of the room, ensure that precautions are maintained to minimize the risk of transmission of microorganisms to other patients and contamination of environmental surfaces or equipment.
### Patient-Care Equipment
- When, possible, dedicate the use of non-critical patient-care equipment to a single patient (or cohort of patients infected or colonized with the pathogen requiring precautions) to avoid sharing between patients. If use of common equipment or items is unavoidable, then adequately clean and disinfect them before use for another patient.

## Common Communicable Disease

### Amoebiasis
- ___Amoebiasis___ is an infection in the bowel, particularly the colon, characterized by diarrhea. This infection can be fatal in infant and to older people with low resistance. The main risk is due to dehydration from loss of fluid.

#### Method of Prevention
- Thoroughly cook all raw foods.
- Thoroughly wash raw vegetables and fruits before eating.
- Reheat food until the internal temperature of the food reaches at least 167° Fahrenheit.
- And do not forget that part of the microwave cooking process, includes careful instructions of the standing times to ensure the food is completely cooked before it is served.

### Chicken Pox
- ___Chicken Pox___ is highly infectious disease caused by virus that is transmitted by airborne droplets from infected patients. Common symptoms are mild fever, body malaise, and itchy rash of dark red pimples from the trunk to the face, scalp and limbs. The pimples develop into blister then scabs which drop off after 12 days.
#### Method of Prevention
- Active immunization with vaccine as necessary.
- Avoid exposure as much as possible to infected person.

### Cholera
- ___Cholera___ is an acute infection of the small intestine by bacteria which cause vomiting and diarrhea (rice water stools leading dehydration). The disease is contracted from the food and drinking water contaminated by the feces of patient infected.
#### Method of Prevention
- Food and water supply must be protected by fecal contamination.
- Water should be boiled or chlorinated.
- Milk should be pasteurized.
- Sanitary disposal of human feces is a must.
- Sanitary supervision is necessary.

### Dengue Fever
- ___Dengue___ or ___break bone fever___ is a viral disease transmitted to man principally by mosquito. Symptoms include severe pain in the joints and muscles, headache, sore throat, fever, and an irritating rash.

#### Method of Prevention
- Avoidance of crowded places
- Immunization
- Educate the public about basic personal hygiene

### Malaria
- ___Malaria___ is an infectious disease caused by the presence of parasites in the red blood cells. The disease is transmitted by a mosquito bites. It result to fever, shaking chills, sweating and even convulsions.
#### Method of Prevention:
- Malaria cases should be reported.
- Screening for infected patients for the carrier mosquitoes
- Destruction of mosquito breeding grounds.
- Use of insecticides, mosquito nets and insect repellants at home
- Blood donors should be properly screened.

### Measles
- ___Measles___ are highly infectious viral disease that mainly affects children. It can be easily transmitted through body secretions. This may be considered on of the most common and most serious of all children diseases.
#### Method of Prevention
- Since the disease is infectious all throughout the period, individuals should avoid  association with infected patients.
- Immunization is highly important.

### Pneumonia
- ___Pneumonia___ is an inflammation of the lungs caused by bacteria in which air sacs are filled with pus and turns the lungs into solid state. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even chemicals may cause pneumonia.
#### Method of Prevention
- Prevent common cold, influenza and other respiratory infections.
- Immunization
- Avoid exposure to cold, pollution and conditions of fatigue or alcoholism.

### Tuberculosis
- ___Tuberculosis___ is a chronic sub-acute and acute infectious disease that affects the lungs and characterized by the formation of tubercles to the nearest nodules. Many people become infected with no signs of symptoms. Infected people tend to transmit this through coughing and sneezing.
#### Method of Prevention
- Submit all babies for BCG immunization.
- Avoid crowded places.
- Improve nutritional and health status.
- Fro infected persons, advise them to prophylactic measures such as x-rays and tuberculin test.
