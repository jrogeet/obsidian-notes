# Vital Signs

___Vital Signs___ include the __Heart Beat__, _Breathing Rate_, __Temperature__ and _Blood Pressure_.

These signs may be watched, measured and monitored to check an individual's _level_ of __Physical Functioning__.

___Normal___ Vital Signs change with `AGE`, `SEX`, `WEIGHT`, `EXERCISE TOLERANCE` and `CONDITION`.

Normal ranges for the average healthy adult vital signs are:
- ___Blood pressure___: __120/80__ mm/Hg

- ___Breathing___: __12__-__18__ breaths per _minute_

- ___Pulse___: __60__-__80__ beats per _minute_ (at rest)

- ___Temperature___: __97.8__ degrees _Fahrenheit/average_ __98.6__ _Fahrenheit_ or __36.5__ to __37.5__ degrees _centigrade_

## PULSE RATE
Defined, as the rate at which the _heart beats_ in __one minute__, pulse rate or the heart beat is indicative of the health of the person. 

As the heart pumps blood into the body, the blood vessels close to the wrist, upper arm and neck start pulsating and throbbing, 

while the _normal pulse_ rate for humans is usually __60__ to __100__ beats __per minute__, there are certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia which may alter the normal pulse rate of an individual.

### How to Calculate Pulse Rate?
You can check your pulse rate by placing tips of you index, second and third fingers on the palm side of you other wrist, below the base of the thumb or on you lower neck, on either side of your windpipe. 

Now count the beats for __10 seconds__ and _multiply_ this number by __six__ to get your pulse. 

Now use a pulse rate chart to find out how well your heart is working and your general health and fitness levels. 

Checking your pulse rates when resting, during exercises or after it, can give information about the overall fitness.

## Normal Pulse Rate Chart

___Resting Pulse Rate Chart___: It is observed that __the lower the resting heart rates, the healthier is you heart.__ 

For calculating this, you have to sit quietly for __10 minutes__ before checking your pulse rates. 

Here is a table to demonstrate the ideal resting heart rates.

### How to take a Radial Pulse
The ___radial artery___ is found close to the inside part of your wrist near your thumb. 
You will need a watch with a second hand to count your pulse. The following steps may help you take your radial pulse.
- Bend your elbow with your arm at your side. The palm of your hand shoul be up.
- Using your middle (long) and index (pointer) fingers, gently feel for the radial artery inside your wrist. You will feel the radial pulse beating when you find it. Do not use your thumb to take the pulse because it has a pulse of its own.
- Count your radial pulse for a full minute (60 seconds). Notice if your pulse has a strong or weak beat.
- Write down your pulse rate, the date, time and what wrist (right or left) was used to take the pulse. Also write down anything you notice about your pulse, such as it being weak, strong, or missing beats.
- The radial artery is an easy artery to use when checking your heart rate during or after exercise.

## RESPIRATION
___Respiration___ is the process that occurs when __oxygen is inhaled__ into the lungs, converted into energy via a chemical reaction and expelled as carbon dioxide. 

___Normal respiration___ is an __automatic process__ and _does not require conscious effort_. 

However, in the case of illness or trauma, a victim’s respiration rate may become unusually high or low indicating the need for immediate medical attention. 

The ___respiratory rate___ is simply the __number of breaths__ an individual takes __per minute__.

### Normal Range
By AGE
- ___Average Respiratory Rates By Age___:

- _Newborns_: __30-40__ breaths per minute

- _Less than 1 year_: __30-40__ breaths per minute

- _1-3_ years: __23-35__ breaths per minute

- _3-6_ years: __20-30__ breaths per minute

- _6-12_ years: __18-26__ breaths per minute

- _12-17_ years: __12-20__ breaths per minute

- Adults _over 18_: __12-20__ breaths per minute

### Steps
- Contact an emergency response team immediately in the event of a server trauma or medical crisis.
- Measure an individual’s respiratory rate while he/she is at rest. Try not to let the victim become aware that you are monitoring respirations in order to obtain a more reliable count.
- Observe the rise and fall of the victim’s chest and count the number of respirations out loud for one full minute.  One respiration consists of one complete rise and fall of the chest, or the inhalation and exhalation of air. The normal respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.
- Categorize the rhythm, ease and strength of the respiration. Normal respiration consists of deep, even breaths during which the rib cage full contracts and relaxes. Abnormal respiration may appear shallow and rapid, labored, shallow and deep or noisy and may indicate illness or injury.
- Record the current time, respiratory rate and respiratory characteristics, if possible.
- Repeat the above steps for measuring and recording respiration rate and characteristics every 10 minutes in an emergency situation. Make a note of any significant changes and relay the information to medical personnel.
#### TIPS
- If first aid is being performed on a victim, monitor respiration immediately after monitoring his or her pulse rate. Do not indicate to the victim that you are now monitoring respiration as he may subconsciously change the rate, depth or strength of his breathing.

## BODY TEMPERATURE

  ___Body temperature___ is a measure of the body’s ability to __generate__ and __get rid__ of heat. 
  
  The body is very good at keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body.
  
 >When you are not too hot, the blood vessels in your skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to your skin’s surface. You may begin to sweat, and as the sweat evaporates, it helps cool your body. When you are too cold, your blood vessels narrow (contract) so that blood flow to your skin is reduced to conserve body heat. You may start shivering, which is an involuntary, rapid contraction of the muscles. This extra activity helps generate more heat. Under normal conditions, this keeps your body temperature within a narrow, safe range.
 

### Where is Body Temperature measured?
Your body temperature can be measured in many locations on your body. 

The _mouth_, _ear_, _armpit_ and _rectum_ are the most commonly used places. Temperature can also be measured on your _forehead_.

### What is Normal Body Temperature?

  Most people think of a “_normal_” body temperature as an ___oral___ temperature of __98.6F__. 
  
  This is an average of normal body temperatures. Tour temperature may actually be __1F (0.6C)__ or more above or below __98.6F__. 
  
  Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as __1F (0.6C)__ throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. 
  
 ___Body temperature___ is __very sensitive__ to __hormone levels__ and may be higher or lower when a woman is _ovulating_ or having her _menstrual period_.

 A ___rectal___ or ___ear___ (tympanic membrane) temperature reading is __0.5__ to __1F (0.3C to 0.6C)__ higher than an ___oral___ temperature reading. 
 
 A temperature taken in the armpit is 0.5 to 1F (0.3 to 0.6C) lower than an oral temperature reading


### Procedure in Taking an ORAL Temperature
- Wash your hands.

- Rinse thermometer in cold water if kept in a chemical solution, and wipe dry with tissue. Rationale: chemical taste is bitter.

- Grasp thermometer with thumb and forefinger and shake vigorously by flicking wrist in downward motion to lower mercury level to below 95-96 degrees.

- Check temperature reading on thermometer.

- Explain procedure to the patient.
- Place thermometer in patient’s mouth under tongue and ask patient to hold lips closed.

- Leave in place 3 to 5 minutes.

- Remove thermometer and wipe it with tissue from fingers down to bulb. Discard tissue.

- Read temperature by rotating thermometer until the mercury level is clearly visible. Shake thermometer down.

- Wash hands.

- Record patient’s temperature according to hospital procedure.

## BLOOD PRESSURE
Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of your body in vessels called arteries. 

___Blood pressure___ is the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. 

Each time the heart beats (about __60-70__ times a _minute_ at rest). It pumps out blood into the _arteries_. 

Your ___blood pressure___ is as its __highest__ when the heart beats, pumping the blood. 

This is called __systolic pressure__. When the heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the __diastolic pressure__.

___Blood pressure___ is always given as these __two numbers__, 

the __systolic__ and __diastolic pressures__. 

Both are important. Usually they are written one above or before the other, such as __120/80__ mmHg. 

The _top number_ is the __systolic__ and the _bottom_ the __diastolic__. 

When the two measurements are written down, the systolic pressure is the first or top number, and the diastolic pressure is the second or bottom number (for example, 120/80). 

If your ___blood pressure___ is __120/80__, you say that it is “__120__ over __80__.”

### Steps in Taking Blood Pressure
- Gather the equipment. You will need s sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff), stethoscope, pen and paper.

- Next you need to identify and greet the patient so that they feel a little more comfortable. You can do so by saying something like ‘Hi (patient’s name) my name is (your name).

- Then you will tell the patient what you are going to do. Again this just makes them feel comfortable. It also lets them know what you are going to do so they are not surprised when you start doing it. You can do so by saying ‘I am going to take your pressure.’
- Then you will ask the patient to expose arm on a flat surface with arm facing upward. If the arm is facing upward it is easier to get to their brachial pulse.

- Next you will expose the arm as much as possible by rolling up the sleeve. By rolling up the sleeve it makes it easier to hear the brachial pulse. You should not roll up the sleeves if the shirt is heavy or tight because it may disrupt the blood flow. If you are not able to roll the sleeves you would ask the patient to please take their arm out of the sleeve.

- Now, squeeze the cuff together in your hands. This removes access in air so that it is easier to place the cuff on the arm.

- Then you turn the valve of the cuff clockwise to close it. Close it so that the air does not escape when I start to pump the cuff.

- Now you are ready to place the cuff around the upper part of the arm about 1 inch below the armpit.

- Then you need to locate the brachial pulse with your middle finger and index finger. The brachial pulse is felt on the brachial artery. This artery is on the inside of your elbow.

- Now you are going to place the ear pieces of the stethoscope into my ears. This enables you to listen for the blood pressure.

- Then you need to write down the systolic and diastolic readings on a piece of paper. You also write them down as soon as you know them so you do not forget.

- Then you deflate the cuff by loosening the valve. To loosen you will turn the valve counter clockwise.

- Then you remove the cuff from the patient’s arm.

- Now you can take the ear pieces of the stethoscope out of your ears.

- Last you record the systolic and diastolic reading into the chart. These are the same readings you wrote down earlier on the piece of paper.
