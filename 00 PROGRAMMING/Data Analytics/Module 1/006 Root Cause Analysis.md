>[!tip] Five Whys
>- A simple but effective technique for identifying a root cause.
>- Ask "Why?" repeatedly, until the answer reveals itself.
>- Often happens at the fifth "why?"

> [!example] Example Scenario
>> [!question] Boost customer service
>> An online grocery store was receiving numerous customer service complaints about poor deliveries. To address this problem, a data analyst at the company asked their first "why?"
>
>
>> [!tip] Why #1. "Customers are complaining about poor grocery deliveries. Why?"
>> The data analyst began by reviewing the customer feedback more closely. 
>> They noted the vast __majority of complaints dealt with products arriving damaged__. So, they asked “why?” again.
>
>
>
>
>> [!tip] Why #2. "Products are arriving damaged. Why?"
>> To answer this question, the data analyst continued exploring the customer feedback.
>>  It turned out that many customers said __products were not packaged properly__.
>
>
>> [!tip] Why #3. "Products are not packaged properly. Why?"
>> After asking their third “why,” the data analyst did some further detective work.
>> They ultimately learned that their company’s __grocery packers were not adequately trained on packing procedures__.
>
>
>> [!tip] Why #4. "Grocery packers are not adequately trained. Why?"
>> This “why” enabled the data analyst to uncover that nearly __35% of all packers were new__ to the company. 
>> They had __not yet had the chance to complete all required training__, yet they were already being asked to pack groceries for customer orders.
>
>
>> [!tip] Why #5. "Packers have not completed required training. Why?"
>> This final “why?” led the data analyst to find out that the human resources department had not provided necessary training to any newly hired packers. 
>> This was because __HR was in the middle of reworking the training program__. Rather than training new hires using the old system, they had provided them with a quick one-page guide, which was insufficient.
>
> - The root cause of the problem was that HR had not completed the training program updates and was using a less-through guide to train new packers.
> 	- Fortunately, this was a problem that the grocer could control.
> 	- And thanks to the data analyst’s work, they provided more support to the HR department to complete the training and retrain all newly hired grocery packers!
