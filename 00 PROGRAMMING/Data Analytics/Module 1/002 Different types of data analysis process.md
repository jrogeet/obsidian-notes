> [!example] EMC's data analysis process (now Dell EMC)
> EMC Corporation's data analytics process is cyclical with six steps:
> 1. Discovery
> 2. Pre-processing data
> 3. Model planning
> 4. Model building
> 5. Communicate results
> 6. Operationalize
> 
>  - created by David Dietrich
>  - The phases aren't static milestones;
> 	 - __each step connects and leads to the next__, and eventually repeats.

> [!example] SAS's iterative process
> created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider.
> 1. Ask
> 2. Prepare
> 3. Explore
> 4. Model
> 5. Implement
> 6. Act
> 7. Evaluate
> 
> - Emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an __infinity symbol__.
> - The difference is the last phase, and it helps analysts evaluate their solutions
> 	- and ___potentially return to the ask phase again___.

> [!example] Project-based data analytics process
> 1. Identifying the problem
> 2. Designing data requirements
> 3. Pre-processing data
> 4. Performing data analysis
> 5. Visualizing data
>    
> - Developed by Vignesh Prajapati
> - __Doesn't include the act/sixth phase__.

> - Has more 3 or 4 more steps
> 	- ___Broken down prepare and process into smaller steps___
> - __Emphasizes individual tasks__ required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.
