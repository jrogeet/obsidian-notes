# HTML
```note-yellow
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to structure that content.
```
## HTML Format/Structure
***
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<!--NOT VISIBLE THINGS IN HTML-->
		<title>Example Title</title>
	</head>


	<body>
	<!--VISIBLE CONTENT IN HTML-->
	<h1>SAMPLE TEXT</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
***
#### Document Type Declaration
The document type declarationÂ `<!DOCTYPE html>`Â is required as the first line of an HTML document. The doctype declaration is an instruction to the browser about what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used, in this case itâ€™s HTML5.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```


#### Element Content
```note-orange
The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element.
```
```html
<h1>Codecademy is awesome! ðŸ™‚</h1>
```

#### HTML Tag
The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracketÂ `<`Â followed by the element name and a closing angle bracketÂ `>`. Here is an example of an openingÂ `<div>`Â tag.
```html
<div>
```
