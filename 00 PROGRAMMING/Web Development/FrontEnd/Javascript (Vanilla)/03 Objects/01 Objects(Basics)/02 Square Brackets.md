# Square Brackets

--- 
Dot access won't work for __multiword properties__
```javascript
// this would give a syntax error
user.likes birds = true
```
- JavaScript thinks that we address `user.likes`
- then gives syntax error when comes across unexpected `birds`

__DOT__ requires valid variable indentifiers
- Contains __no spaces__
- doesn't start with a __digit__
- Doesn't include special characters (`$` and `_` are allowed).

## Square bracket notation
Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation.
They allow any property names and variables.
Words with any string:
- _String_ inside the brackets is properly `quoted` (any type of quotes).
```javascript
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

Square brackets are also use to obtain `property name` as the result of _any expression_:
```javascript
let key = "likes birds";

// same as user["likes birds"] = true;
user[key] = true;
```

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30
};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");

// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
```

`Dot notation` __cannot be used__ in a similar way:
```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30
};
let key = "name";
alert( user.key ) // undefined
```

## Computer properties
```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
	[fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```
works the same as:
```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

bag[fruit] = 5;
```

```javascript
let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
	[fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```
