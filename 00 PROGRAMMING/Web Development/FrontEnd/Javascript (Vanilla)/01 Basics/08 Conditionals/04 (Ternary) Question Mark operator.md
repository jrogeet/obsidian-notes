# 04 Question Mark operator

--- 
"conditional" or "question mark" operator `?`
>[!Tip] Syntax:
>```javascript
> condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
>
>let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
>```


>[!info]
> - Represented by a question mark `?`
> - Sometimes called "__ternary__"
> 	- because it has ___Three operands___
> 	- One and only operator in JavaScript which has that many

It let us do this in shorter way:
```javascript
let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

if (age > 18) {
	accessAllowed = true;
} else {
	accessAllowed = false;
}

alert(accessAllowed);
```

```javascript
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true: false;
//OR

// the comparison operator "age > 18" executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;
```
>[!note] 
>The comparison itself returns `true/false`
>	- There's no need to use the __question mark / ternary operator__ just like the code above.
>```javascript
>// the same
>let accessAllowed = age > 18;
>```

>[!Caution] Not recommended way of using Ternary operator:
>It may be shorter but not readable compared to using `if...else`
> ```javascript
> let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', ' ');
> 
> (company ==  'Netscape') ?
> 	alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
> ```
> We didn't assigned result to a variable here, instead it executed different code depends on the condition.
> 
> `If...else` version:
> ```javascript
> let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', ' ');
> 
> if (company == 'Netscape') {
> 	alert('Right!');
> } else {
> 	alert('Wrong.');
> }
> ```
