# 03 Else & else if clause

--- 
The `else` block executes when `if` statement is false.

```javascript
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

if (year == 2015) {
	alert( 'You guessed it right!' )
} else {
	alert( 'How can you be so wrong?' ); // any value except 2015
}
```

## Else if
Let us test several variants of a condition with `else if`

```javascript
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

if (year < 2015) {
	alert( 'Too early...' );
} else if (year > 2015) {
	alert( 'Too late' )
} else {
	alert( 'Exactly!' );
}
```
- JavaScript checks `year < 2015`,
	- if false, goes to the next condition `year > 2015`
		- If false again, it shows the `else`'s `alert`
