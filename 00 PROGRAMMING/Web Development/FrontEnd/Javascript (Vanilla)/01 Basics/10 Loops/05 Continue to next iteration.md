# 05 Continue to next iteration

--- 
"lighter version of `break`"
Doesn't stop the whole loop,
It stops the __current iteration__ and forces the loop to start a new one.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

	// if true, skip the remaining part of the body
	if (i % 2 == 0) continue;

	alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```

>[!Tip] `continue` directive helps decrease _nesting_
> The same as above, but less readable:
>```javascript
>for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
>	if (i % 2) {
>		alert( i );
>	}
>}
>```

>[!danger] No `break/continue` to the right side of `?`
>Syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with ternary operator `?`
>- like `break/continue` aren't allowed:
>```javascript
>if (i > 5) {
>	alert(i);
>} else {
>	continue;
>}
>```
>rewrite using question mark:
>```javascript
>(i > 5) ? alert(i) : continue; // continue isn't allowed here
>```
