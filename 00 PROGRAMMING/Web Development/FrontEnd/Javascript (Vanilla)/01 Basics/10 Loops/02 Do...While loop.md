# 02 Do...While loop

--- 
Syntax:
```javascript
do {
	// loop body
} while (condition);
```

- Execute the body first / once
- Check the condition, while it's true/truthy
- Execute it again and again

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
	alert( i );
	i++;
} while (i < 3);
```

>[!tip]
>Should only be used when you want the body to execute __at least once__ regardless of the condition being true / truthy

### More Examples:

```javascript
let num;

do {
	num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0)
} while (num <= 100 && num);
```
- check for `num <= 100`, if entered value is still not greater than `100`
- `&& num` is false when `num` is `null` or _empty string_.
	- Then `while` loop stops too.
- If `num` is `null` then `num <= 100` is `true`
	- without 2nd check the loop wouldn't stop if the user clicks __CANCEL__.
		- Both checks are required.
