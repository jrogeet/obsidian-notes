# 04 Strict equality

--- 
>[!danger]- Problem
>A regular equality check `==` cannot differentiate `0` from `false`.

>>[!question]- Why?
>>Operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator `==`
>>	Empty string like `false`, becomes a zero.

To differentiate `0` from `false`
Use ___String Equality Operator___ `===`
- Checks the equality without type conversion.
- If `a` and `b` are of different types
	- `a === b` immediately returns `false`
		- without an attempt to converting them
```javascript
alert( 0 === false ); // false, because the types are different
```

There's also __Strict Non-equality__ operator `!==`
