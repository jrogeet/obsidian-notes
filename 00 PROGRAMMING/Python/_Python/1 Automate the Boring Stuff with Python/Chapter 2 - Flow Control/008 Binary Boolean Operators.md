# Binary Boolean Operators
The `and` and `or` operators always take two Boolean values (or expressions), so they’re considered `binary` operators.

### and Operator
The `and` operator results to `True` if both Boolean values are `True`; Otherwise, it results to `False`.

### not Operator
the `not` operator operates on only one Boolean value (or expression). This makes it a `unary` operator.

The `not` operator simply reverse the Boolean value.
