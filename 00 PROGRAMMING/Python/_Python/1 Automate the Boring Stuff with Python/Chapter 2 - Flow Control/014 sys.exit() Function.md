# **Ending a Program Early with the sys.exit() Function**

Programs always terminate if the program execution reaches the bottom of the instructions. 

However, you can cause the program to **terminate, or exit**, before the last instruction by calling the ***sys.exit()*** function.

```python
import sys  
  
while True:  
    print('Type exit to exit.')  
    response = input()  
    if response == 'exit':  
        sys.exit()  
    print('You typed ' + response + '.')
```
