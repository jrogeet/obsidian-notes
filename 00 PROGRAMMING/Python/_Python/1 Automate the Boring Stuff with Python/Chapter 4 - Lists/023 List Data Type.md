Lists and tuples can contain multiple values, which makes writing programs that handle large amounts of data easier. And since lists themselves can contain other lists, you can use them to arrange data into hierarchical structures.

# List Data Type
A ___list___ is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence.

 - A list value looks like this: ___['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']___.
-  A list begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket, \__[ ]__.   
- Values inside the list are also called _items_. Items are separated with commas (that is, they are _comma-delimited_).

```python
[1, 2, 3]

['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']

['hello', 3.1415, True, None, 42]

spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
spam
```
