# Methods
A _method_ is the same thing as a function, except it is __“called on”__ a value.

For example, if a list value were stored in ___spam___, you would call the __index() list method__ on that list like so: ___spam.index('hello')___. 

The method part comes after the value, separated by a period.

>Each data type has its own set of methods. 

The ___list___ data type, for example, has several useful methods for ___finding___, ___adding___, ___removing___, and otherwise __manipulating values in a list__.
