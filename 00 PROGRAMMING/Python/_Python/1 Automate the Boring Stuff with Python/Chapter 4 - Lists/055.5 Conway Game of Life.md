## Explanation:

First, import modules: ___random___, ___time___ and ___copy___. 
then set the width of the board or table, ___WIDTH = 60___ and ___HEIGHT = 20___. 
```python
import random, time, copy
WIDTH = 60
HEIGHT = 20
```

The first set of table will be completely __RANDOM__. 
- First, we create a list name: ___nextCells___
- then the ___for loop___ starts, and the will loop times the value of ___WIDTH___, which is __60__
- Created a list ___column___, then the ___for loop___ for ___HEIGHT___ starts(this loop would progress to the right or by __Column__)
- the ___if-else___ statement will generate a random number between __0__ and __1__, and if the randomized number is equal to ___0___ : it will append or add ___#___ into the list name ___column___, or else just ___'  '___.
- then it will append or add ___column___ list into ___nextCells___
```python
# Create a list of list for the cells:  
nextCells = []  
for x in range(WIDTH):  
	column = [] # Create a new column.  
	for y in range(HEIGHT):  
		if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:  
			column.append('#') # Add a living cell.  
		else:  
			column.append(' ') # Add a dead cell.  
	nextCells.append(column) # nextCells is a list of column Lists. 
```

Main Program Loop:
- First step in our main program loop will be to copy ___nextCells___ into the variable ___currentCells.___ 
```python
while True: # Main program loop.
	print('\n\n\n\n\n') # Separate each step with newlines.
	currentCells = copy.deepcopy(nextCells)
```

- then the we will print the __Table of Cells__ with a ___forloop___: It will start with ___HEIGHT___ or per __row__ 
- After printing __1 row__, ___for x in range(WIDTH):___ will then print __60 columns__.
- This will repeat times the ___HEIGHT___ which is __20__.
- Inside the ___WIDTH___ for loop, is the print statement that will print the values from ___currentCells___, the __[x]__ and __[y]__ are based on the __y__ and __x__ from the for loop( for ___y___ in range(HEIGHT) and for ___x___ in range(WIDTH) ) 
- so, when the for loop starts the ___y___ became __0__ then the ___x___ became __0__ too. Then, the ___x___ became __1__, because the ___forloop___ will count upto __60__ or times the ___WIDTH___ value.
```python
# Print currentCells on the screen:  
	for y in range(HEIGHT):  
		for x in range(WIDTH):  
			print(currentCells[x][y], end='') # Print the # or space. The[x] and [y] will print the each o  
		print() # Print a newline at the end of the row.  
```

Calculate the next step's cells based on current step's cells
- Another double for loop
- then get the neighboring coordinates on each direction of each cells
- the ___% WIDTH___ ensures that the coordinates are still inside the edges of the board
- It would ensure that ___leftCoord___ and ___rightCoord___ are always between ___0___ and ___WIDTH - 1___ 
- or that it will not be out of bounds.
```python
# Calculate the next step's cells based on current step's cells:  
	for x in range(WIDTH):  
		for y in range(HEIGHT):  
			# Get neighboring coordinates:  
			# '% WIDTH' ensures leftCoord is always between 0 and WIDTH - 1  
			leftCoord = (x - 1) % WIDTH  
			rightCoord = (x + 1) % WIDTH  
			aboveCoord = (y - 1) % HEIGHT  
			belowCoord = (y + 1) % HEIGHT  
```

Counting the number of living neighbors of each cell
- For each cell, the code checks the status of its eight neighbors (_top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, and bottom-right_)
- For example, the line ___if currentCells[leftCoord][aboveCoord] == '#':___ checks if the cell that is located __above__ and to the __left__ of the current cell is alive.
- If a neighbor is alive (___'#'___), the code increments the ___numNeighbors___ variable.
```python
# Count number of living neighbors:  
			numNeighbors = 0  
			if currentCells[leftCoord][aboveCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Top-left neighbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[x][aboveCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Top neighbor is alive  
			if currentCells[rightCoord][aboveCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Top-right neighbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[leftCoord][y] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Left neightbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[rightCoord][y] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Right neighbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[leftCoord][belowCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Bottom-left neightbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[x][belowCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Bottom neighbor is alive.  
			if currentCells[rightCoord][belowCoord] == '#':  
				numNeighbors += 1 # Bottom-right neighbor is alive. 
```

This would decide whether the ___Current Cell___ will live next time
- Check whether the ___currentCells___ is alive or has a ___#___ in it.
- __AND__ check whether it has either ___2___ or ___3___ currently __ALIVE__ neighbors
- if YES, then it will live for the next table
```python
# Set cell based on Conway's Game of Life rules:  
			if currentCells[x][y] == '#' and (numNeighbors == 2 or numNeighbors == 3):  
# Living cells with 2 or 3 neighbors stay alive:  
				nextCells[x][y] = '#'  

```
- then check the currently __DEAD__ or empty cell if it has a total of ___3___ alive neighbors
- if YES, then it will live for the next table
```python
			elif currentCells[x][y] == ' ' and numNeighbors == 3:  
# Dead cells with 3 neighbors become alive:  
				nextCells[x][y] = '#'  
```

If _NONE_ of these are _applicable_, then the current cell will be __DEAD__ in the next table.
```python			
			else:  
# Everything else dies or stays dead:  
				nextCells[x][y] = ' '  
```

This would add a delay to display each table of cells to reduce flickering.
```python
	time.sleep(1) # Add a 1-second pause to reduce flickering.
```
