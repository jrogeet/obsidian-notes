# List Concatenation and List Replication

Lists can be concatenated and replicated just like strings.

To __COMBINE__ _two lists_ to create a new list value, use __plus__( ___+___ ) operator.
```python
concatenate = [1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C']

print(concatenate)
```

To __REPLICATE__ a list, use __multiply__( ___*___ ) together with an _integer_ value.
```python
replicate = ['X', 'Y', 'Z'] * 3

print(replicate)
```

More:
```python
spam = [1, 2, 3]
spam = spam + ['A', 'B', 'C']

print(spam)
```
