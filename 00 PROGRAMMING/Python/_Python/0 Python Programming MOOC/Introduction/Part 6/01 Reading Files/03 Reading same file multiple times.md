# Reading the same file multiple times

--- 
```sample data
Peter;40;Helsinki 
Emily;34;Espoo 
Eric;42;London 
Adam;100;Amsterdam 
Alice;58;Paris
```

>[!danger] Running this will result in a somewhat cryptic error message:
>```python
>with open("people.csv") as new_file:
>	# print out the names
>	for line in new_file:
>		parts = line.split(";")
>		print("Name:", parts[0])
>
>	# find the oldest
>	age_of_oldest = -1
>	for line in new_file:
>		parts = line.split(";")
>		name = parts[0]
>		age = int(parts[1])
>		if age > age_of_oldest:
>			age_of_oldest = age
>			oldest = name
>	print("the oldest is", oldest)
>```
> - The last `for` loop is not executed at all
> 	- because the file can only be processed once

>[!done] Solutions:
>1. This would work but it contains unnecessary repetition.
