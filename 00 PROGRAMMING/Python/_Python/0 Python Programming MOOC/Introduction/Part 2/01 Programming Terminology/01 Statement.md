# 01 Statement

--- 
A _statement_ is a part of the program which executes something. It often, but not always, refers to a single command.

For example, ___`print("Hi!")`___ is a statement which prints out a line of text. Likewise, ___`number = 2`___ is a statement which assigns a value to a variable.

A statement can also be more complicated. It can, for instance, contain other statements. The following statement spans three lines:

```python
if name == "Anna":
    print("Hi!")
    number = 2
```

In the above case there are two statements (a print statement and an assignment statement) within a conditional statement.
