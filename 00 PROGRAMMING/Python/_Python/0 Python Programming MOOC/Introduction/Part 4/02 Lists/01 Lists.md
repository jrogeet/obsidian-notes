# Lists

A Python _list_ is a collection of values which is accessed via a single variable name. The contents of the list are written within square brackets. The values contained in the list are called _items_, or sometimes _elements_.

```python
my_list = [] # THIS CREATES A NEW, EMPTY LIST

my_list = [7, 2, 2, 5, 2] # THIS CREATES A LIST WITH FIVE ITEMS IN IT
```
