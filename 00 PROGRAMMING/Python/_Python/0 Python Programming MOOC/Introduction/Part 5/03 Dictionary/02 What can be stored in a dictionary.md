# 02 What can be stored in a dictionary

--- 
The data type is called ___dictionary___, but it doesn't have to contain only strings.

For example, in the following dictionary the keys are __strings__, but the values are ___integers___:

```python
results = {}
results["Mary"] = 4
results["Alice"] = 5
results["Larry"] = 2
```

Here the keys are integers and the values are lists:
```python
lists = {}
lists[5] = [1, 2, 3]
lists[42] = [5, 4, 5, 4, 5]
lists[100] = [5, 2, 3]
```
