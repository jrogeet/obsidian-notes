#  Reminder: using global variables within functions
Functions can assign new variables within function definitions, but the function can also see variables assigned outside it, in the main function.

Such variables are called ___global variables___

It's a bad idea to use global variables within a function since it may cause bugs which are difficult to trace.

Example of mistakenly using global variable within a function:
```python
def print_reversed(names: list):
	# Using the global variables instead of the parameter by accident
	i = len(name_list) - 1
	while i >= 0:
		print(name_list[i])
		i -= 1
# here the global variable is assigned
name_list = ["Steve", "Jean", "Katherine", "Paul"]
print_reversed(name_list)
print()
print_reversed(["Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"])
```

The function always prints out what is stored in the global variable __`name_list`__.

To make matters even more muddled, remember that all code for testing your functions should be placed within the __`if __name__ == "__main__":`__ block for the automatic tests. The previous example should be modified:

```python
def print_reversed(names: list):
    # using the global variable instead of the parameter by accident
    i = len(name_list) - 1
    while i>=0:
        print(name_list[i])
        i -= 1

# All the code for testing the function should be within this block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # here the global variable is assigned
    name_list = ["Steve", "Jean", "Katherine", "Paul"]
    print_reversed(name_list)
    print()
    print_reversed(["Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"])
```

Notice the global variable is assigned within the __`if`__ block now.
