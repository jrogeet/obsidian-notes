# Lists with different types of data

```python
names = ["Marlyn", "Ruth", "Paul"]
print(names)
names.append("David")
print(names)

print("Number of names on the list:", len(names))
print("Names in alphabetical order:")
names.sort()
for name in names:
	print(name)
```

Floating point numbers are also valid list items:
```python
measurements = [-2.5, 1.1, 7.5, 14.6, 21.0, 19.2]

for measure in measurements:
	print(measure)
mean = sum(measurements) / len(measurements)

print("The mean is:", mean)
```
