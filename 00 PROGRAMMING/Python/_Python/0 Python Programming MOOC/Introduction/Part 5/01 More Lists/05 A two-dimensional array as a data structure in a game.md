# 05 A two-dimensional array as a data structure in a game

--- 
A matrix can be a very useful data structure in many different games. For example, the grid of a sudoku game in the image below

![[Pasted image 20230831150931.png]]

can be represented in matrix form like so:

```python
sudoku = [
  [9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
  [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0],
  [7, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
]
```

Here the value zero represents an empty square, as zero is not an acceptable value in a finished sudoku puzzle.

Here is a simple function for printing out the above sudoku grid:

```python
def print_grid(sudoku):
    for row in sudoku:
        for square in row:
            if square > 0:
                print(f" {square}", end="")
            else:
                print(" _", end="")
        print()

print_grid(sudoku)
```

The printout should look like this::

```x

 9 _ _ _ 8 _ 3 _ _
 _ _ _ 2 5 _ 7 _ _
 _ 2 _ 3 _ _ _ _ 4
 _ 9 4 _ _ _ _ _ _
 _ _ _ 7 3 _ 5 6 _
 7 _ 5 _ 6 _ 4 _ _
 _ _ 7 8 _ 3 9 _ _
 _ _ 1 _ _ _ _ _ 3
 3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2
```

Any common game with a gameboard layout can be modelled in a similar fashion. Among others, chess, Minesweeper, Battleship or Mastermind are all based on a two-dimensional grid. For sudoku, it is natural to use numbers to represent the game state, but for other games, different methods may be better.
