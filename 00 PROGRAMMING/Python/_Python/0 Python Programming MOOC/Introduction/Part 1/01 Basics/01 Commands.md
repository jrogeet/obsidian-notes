# 01 Commands

--- 
Computer programs consist of _commands_, each command instructing the computer to take some action. 

A computer executes these commands one by one. 
Among other things, commands can be used to perform calculations, compare things in the computer's memory, cause changes in how the program functions, relay messages or ask for information from the program's user.

## print command
___`print`___ command prints text
printing means the program will show some text on the screen.

```python
print("Hi there!")
```

> The program will not work unless the code is written exactly as it is above. For example, trying to run the print command without the quotation marks, like so

```python
print(Hi there!)
```

will not print out the message, but instead causes an error:
```python
File "", line 1
  print(Hi there!)
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
