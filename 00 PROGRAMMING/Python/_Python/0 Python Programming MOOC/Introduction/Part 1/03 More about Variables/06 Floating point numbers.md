# 06 Floating point numbers

--- 
`Floating point number` or _float_ is a term you will come across often in programming. It refers to numbers with a decimal point. They can be used much in the same way as integer values.

This program calculates the mean of three floating point numbers:

```python
number1 = 2.5
number2 = -1.25
number3 = 3.62

mean = (number1 + number2 + number3) / 3
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
```
