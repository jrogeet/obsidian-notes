> [!tip] Establishing goals and objectives
> - __Goals__: broad, long-term achievable outcomes
> - __Objectives__: actionable, measurable actions that achieve the goal

> [!tip] Eliciting, documenting, confirming
> - __Elicit__
> 	- Surveys
> 	- Questionnaires
> 	- Interviews
> - __Document__
> 	- Align with goals and objectives
> 	- Easily understood
> - __Confirm__
> 	- Consistency
> 	- Clarity
> 	- Completeness

> [!tip] Prioritizing
> Labels:
> - Must-have
> - Highly desired
> - Nice to have

 > [!info] ###### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
 > - Captures functionalities the software should perform
 > - Establishes benchmarks / service-levels for performance
 > - Purpose and scope
 > - Constraints, assumptions, dependencies
 > - __Requirements__
 > 	- Functional
 > 	- External interface
 > 	- System features
 > 	- Non-functional
 > 
 >> [!tip] Purpose and Scope
 >> - __Purpose__
 >> 	- Who has access to the SRS
 >> 	- How it should be used
>> - __Scope__
>> 	- Software benefits
>> 	- Goals
>> 	- Objectives
>
>
>> [!tip] Constraints, assumptions, dependencies
>> - __Constraints__: how the software must operate under given conditions
>> - __Assumptions__: required OS or hardware
>> - __Dependencies__: on other software products
>
>
>> [!tip] Requirements
>> - __Functional__: functions of the software
>> - __External__: users and interactions with other hardware or software
>> - __System features__: functions of the system
>> - __Non-functional__: performance, safety, security, quality

> [!info] ###### User Requirements Specification (URS)
> - Describe business need and end-user expectations
> 
> - __User stories:__ 
> 	- Who is the user?
> 	- What is the function that needs to be performed?
> 	- Why does the user want this functionality?
> 
> 
> - Confirmed during user acceptance testing
> - Often combined into the SRS

> [!info] ###### System Requirements Specification (SysRS)
> - Outlines __requirements of the system__
> - Broader than an SRS
> 
> - Contains:
> 	- System capabilities
> 	- Interfaces and user characteristics
> 	- Policy
> 	- Regulation
> 	- Personnel
> 	- Performance
> 	- Security
> 	- System acceptance criteria
