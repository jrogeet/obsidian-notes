> [!abstract] SDLC
> - A systematic process to develop quality software in a _predictable timeframe_ and _budget_
> - Aims to produce software that meets requirements
> - Defined phases with their own processes and deliverables
> - Cycle of planning, design, and development
> - Minimizes development risks and costs

> [!info] History of SDLC
> - Conceived of in the mid-1960s
> - A deliberate approach needed to manage complex projects
> - Initially used the __waterfall method__
> - Adapted to use iterative methods

> [!example] ###### Phase 1: Planning
> Requirements are:
> - Gathered
> - Analyzed
> - Documented
> - Prioritized
> 
>  When planning a software solution, the ff. factors  must be considered:
>  - Users of the solution
>  - Overall purpose of solution
>  - Data Inputs/Outputs
>  - Legal and Regulatory Compliance
>  - Risk identifications
>  - Quality Assurance Requirements
>  - Allocation of Human and Financial Resources, 
>  - Project Scheduling

>> [!tip] Prototyping
>> Prototyping often happens during Planning phase
>> - If stakeholders are struggling in defining the requirements
>> - Small-scale replica to clarify requirements
>> - Tests design ideas
>> - Can be developed at various stages of the SDLC
>
>
>> [!info] __SRS__ - Software requirements specification
>> - Requirements are documented in the SRS
>> - All stakeholders must agree

> [!example] ###### Phase 2: Design
>  - Requirements are gathered from the __SRS__ to develop software architecture.
>  - The architecture are reviewed by the stakeholders and team
> 	 - Prototypes(Preliminary Mock-Up / Demo) can be designed
>  - __Design Document__: The document created in this phase, used by developers.

> [!example] ###### Phase 3: Development
> - Start of the coding process
> - Project planners uses the __Design Document__ to determine and  assign  coding tasks:

> [!example] ###### Phase 4: Testing
> ![[Pasted image 20241205195411.png]]
> Testing Levels:
> - Unit
> - Integration
> - System
> - Acceptance

> [!example] ###### Phase 5: Deployment
> Where the application is released into the production environment and is made available to the users
