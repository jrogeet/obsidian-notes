> [!tip] Waterfall method
> - __Sequential method__ of software development where the _output of a phase_ is the ___input of the next phase___
> - Development and work on the next phase, start only after the completion of the previous phase
> - The client doesn't see the product until it's in __testing phase__

> [!tip] V-shape model
> - similar to __Waterfall method__  as they are both sequential
> - In the left of the V, is the Verification and on the right is Validation

> - Teams works in cycle or sprints which is about 1-4 weeks long
> 	- Unit Testing happens in each sprint to minimize risk of failure
> - At the end of each sprint, the demo is presented in a meeting for client to see functionality and provide feedback
