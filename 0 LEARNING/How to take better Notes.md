> - Our __Cognitive Load__ is small, we need to use more portion of our cognitive load to really understand what we're learning
> 	- _Reading_, while _Typing/Taking Notes_, and _Problem Solving_ will take a huge amount of our __Cognitive Load__.
> 		- This would result to us not really understanding and learning the material.
