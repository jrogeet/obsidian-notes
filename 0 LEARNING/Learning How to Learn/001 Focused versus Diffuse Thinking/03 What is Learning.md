# What is Learning?

---

What we do that we take for granted like seeing, hearing, reaching and running are all much complex problem than we thought.


Here is an image of activity map of someone's brain who was asked to lie still, at rest in a brain imaging scanner.

- The __blue__ areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, __BUT turn off at the resting state.__
- The _red-orange_ areas are most active in the resting state and are called the ___default mode network___.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a __MILLION BILLION__ ___synapses___ in our brain where memories are stored.

The strengths of synapses can be adjusted by learning, but the pattern of connectivity does not change much unless there is brain damage.


### How do memories stay stable over so many years?

This is a picture of one _dendritic branch on a neuron_ which receives inputs from other neurons.

The _synapses_ are on the spiny knobs coming off the __dendrite__.

On the top the __dendrite__ was imaged before learning.

The same __dendrite__ is shown below _after learning and after sleep_.

___Multiple synapses___ are newly formed together on the same branch are indicated by _white arrowheads_.

This is a brain of a live animal.

Synapses are less than a micron in diameter.

It's as if you went to bed with one brain and woke up with an __upgrade__.
