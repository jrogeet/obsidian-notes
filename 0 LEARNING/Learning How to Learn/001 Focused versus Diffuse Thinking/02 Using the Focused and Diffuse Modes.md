# 02 Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

---

_When you're learning something new_, especially something that's a little more _difficult_,
Your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the __two different learning modes__.

Just like joining a Weightlifting Competition, you would not wait until the day before the competition and just work out like a fiend.

You need to put on a little work everyday gradually allowing your muscles to grow.


_Similarly, to build neural structure_
__You need to do a little work everyday__
gradually allowing yourself to grow a __neuro-scaffold__
to hang your thinking on.
