# Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

---

Two Fundamentally different modes of thinking:
- ## Focused

the Orange pattern represents familiar thought pattern (it maybe involve something simple like adding numbers or more advance ideas etc.)

As you think a thought the ball moves smoothly though the pattern. 
As it's bouncing towards the bumpers, you're able to figure out the problem you're trying to solve or the concept you're trying to understand that is _related to something you're familiar with_.

__BUT what if you're working on needs new ideas or approaches? 
Concepts you never thought of before?__

You don't even know how that pattern feels or where it is.
and it is blocked by all these bumpers

___To get to these new thought pattern, you need a different way of thinking.___
- ## Diffuse mode

In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective.
