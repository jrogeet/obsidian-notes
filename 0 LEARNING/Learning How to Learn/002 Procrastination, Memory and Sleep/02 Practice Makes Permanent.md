# Practice Makes Permanent

---

Why does everything that has math or science seems a bit more challenging?


It may be related to the abstract nature of the ideas. 

For example, a cow. You can just point into a cow and the spelling is just C-O-W.

but for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to.
Like there's no ___plus___ sign, ___multiplication___, ___division sign___ out in a plain field.

These terms are abstract, in other words.

but what about the term ___love___, ___zest___ and ___hope___?
These things are related to our __emotion__, even though we can't see them, We can feel our emotions.

_The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you._

Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete.

__At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice__.

When you first began to understand something, for example: How to solve a problem,
the neural pattern form is there, but VERY WEAK.

When you solve the problem again, fresh from the start, without looking at the solution. You begin deepening that neural pattern.

And when you have the problem down cold, 
so you can go each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution,
and you've even had practice on related problems.

### Building strong neural structures
- Study it hard by focusing intently.
- Then take a break or at least _change your focus_ to _something different for awhile_.

During this relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work a way in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. 

Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry.

If you don't do this and instead learn by _cramming_, your knowledge base will look like this:

	all in a jumble with everything confused, __a poor foundation__.

This is why ___Pomodoro___ is a great technique to use while studying.
