# 01 Procrastination

---

When you look at something that you would rather not do, It seems like you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else.

but here's the trick:
Researchers discovered that _not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like,_ __that neurodiscomfort disappeared.__

## This is what happens when you procastinate:

1. First you _observe_, and get a __cue__ about something that causes a __tiny bit of unease__.

2. So to make the sensation _go away_, __you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease__. To something more pleasant, and the result you feel happier (TEMPORARILY).
