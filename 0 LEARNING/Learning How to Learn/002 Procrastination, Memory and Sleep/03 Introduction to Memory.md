# 03 Introduction to Memory

## Working Memory
Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you're _immediately and consciously processing in your mind_.

Your working memory is centered out of the __prefrontal cortex__ although as we'll see later, there are also connections to other parts of the brain so you can access long-term memories.

___Working memory___ only holds only about __four chunks of information__.

Working memory is like a blackboard, but its not a very good blackboard.
	You often needs to keep repeating what you're trying to work with so it stays in your working memory.
	For example: You need to repeat a phone number before you have a chance to write it down.

___Repetitions___ needed so that your metabolic vampires that is natural dissipating processes don't suck those memories away.

> Short-term memory is something like an inefficient mental blackboard.
## Long Term memory
> Long term memory is like a storage warehouse.

It's distributed over a big area..
Different kinds of long-term memory are distributed through out the brain.

When you first try to put an item of information in long-term memory, 
you need to revisit it a couple of times to increase the chances that you'll be able to find it later when you might need it.


> [!NOTE]
> _Long Term Memory_ is important because that's where you store the fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.

When you encounter something new, You often use your [[#Working Memory]] to handle it.

If you want to move that information into your ___long-term memory___,

> It often takes time and practice.

To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition.

# Spaced Repetition
This involves repeating what you're trying to retain.

Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example. Over a number of days.
