Double-spending is when you have a piece of information and you spent it Twice.

Each ___Bitcoin___ has a unique identifier called a "__transaction ID__" or "__TXID__" , which is a long string of letters and numbers that identifies the specific Bitcoin. 

When a Bitcoin is sent from one person to another, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and the ___TXID is updated to reflect the new owner___ of the Bitcoin. 

The double-spending problem occurs when someone tries to __spend the same Bitcoin more than once__ _by creating two transactions with the same TXID_.

To prevent double-spending, Bitcoin uses a ___decentralized blockchain___ that combines an __open ledger__ with cryptographic algorithms to ensure that each transaction is unique and cannot be duplicated
