- A Merkle tree is a tree-like data structure used in cryptography and computer science to verify the integrity and authenticity of data.
- It is also known as a hash tree, and it is named after Ralph Merkle, who patented it in 1979.
- A Merkle tree is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf is labeled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its children.
- The Merkle tree is used to ensure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks.
- The Merkle tree is a binary tree, and the top hash is a hash of the entire tree.
- The structure of the tree allows efficient mapping of huge data, and small changes made to the data can be easily identified.
- Merkle trees are used in distributed systems for efficient data verification, and they are efficient because they use hashes instead of full files.
- Merkle trees are used in blockchain technology to efficiently verify the integrity of large amounts of data, and they enable quick and secure content verification across big datasets and verify the consistency and content of the data.
