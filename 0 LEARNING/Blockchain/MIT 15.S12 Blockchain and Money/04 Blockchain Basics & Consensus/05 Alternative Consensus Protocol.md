Generally Randomized or Delegated Selection of Nodes to Validate next Block
- May have added mechanism to confirm Block Validators’ Work

Randomized Selection May be Based upon:
- Proof of Stake - Stake in Native Currency
- Proof of Activity - Hybrid of POW and POS
- Proof of Burn - Validation comes with Burning of Coins
- Proof of Capacity (Storage or Space) - Based upon Hardware Space

Delegated Selection May be Based upon Tiered System of Nodes 

Major Permissionless Blockchain Applications still use Proof of Work – though:
- DASH is a hybrid of POW with a tiered system of ‘Masternodes’
- NEO uses a Delegated protocol of ‘Professional Nodes’
