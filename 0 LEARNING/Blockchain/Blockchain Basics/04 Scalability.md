- If a lot of people want to send a transaction, the gas prices can get really high
- More people use blockchain, gas price skyrockets
- There's a limit to block space 

## Sharding
Blockchain of blockchains


# Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Avalanche

# Layer 2: Any application build on top of Layer 1
- Chainlink
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
Arbitrum and Optimism is what's called ___Rollup___,
Since they "rollup" their transactions into a Layer 1 like  Ethereum

## Rollup
- Like a sharded chain
- Derived their security from the Base Layer /  layer 1
- Bulk sends transactions into Layer 1
- Different from __Sidechains__: derive their security from their own protocol
