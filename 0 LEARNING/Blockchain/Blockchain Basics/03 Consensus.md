Consensus protocol can be broken down into 2 pieces:
1. Chain Selection Algorithm
2. Sybil Resistance Mechanism

## 2 Types of Sybil Resistance Mechanism

>[!EXAMPLE] Proof-of-Work (PoW)
> - The agreement of all Nodes on things like Account Balances and Order of Transactions
> - Prevents "double-spending"
> - Sets the rules and difficulty of the work miners do

>[!Example] Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
> - Nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism
> 	- Nodes will lose the money they stake if they misbehave
> - Replaces ___Miners___ with __Validators__. 
> - __Validators__ stake their ___ETH___ to activate the ability to create new blocks
> - __Validators__ don't compete to create blocks
> - They are chosen at ___random___ by an _algorithm_
>> [!check] Pros and Cons
>> - Pros:
>> 	-  Uses much less energy
>> 	- Instead of every nodes working on a certain problem, only 1 has to do it and the other will just validate it
>> - Cons:
>> 	- Slightly less decentralized network because of the upfront staking cost
