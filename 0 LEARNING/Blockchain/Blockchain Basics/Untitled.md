The MC uses conscience and reasoning about the kid's life.
The other juries are thinking logically, I think he is trying to reason with them emotionally.
He's talking about the action of the kid is just the fruit of how he is raised.

First guy that tried to persuade him, can't talk about how
- The MC is confident in how he talk and always find a hole into other's arguments.

2nd guy, based on evidence and the witness is the old man downstairs
3rd guy, also based on evidence but the testimony of the kid
The Annoying guy, based  on the testimony of the woman across the street who saw the killing

Him beating the first guys in the argument resulted in other juries low esteem and uses reasoning again in how the boy is raised by beating

The guy with the hat uses the kid's  history

I think the MC reasoned with morals and humanity instead of logic and laws

He's arguing with every possible reason that could be connected to the topic
	He's using pure reasoning with morals, humanity and conscience
He's agreeing to what other is saying, while still proving his point

EVEN THOUGH the other juries have good points, uses evidence

MC repeats and agrees to what the other jury is saying and then say his counter argument
